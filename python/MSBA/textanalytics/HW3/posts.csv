"""As a Mercedes fan, I was sad, but I knew that those were not typical situations..""You're absolutely right. Take my previous '01 SClass. This was pre-'03 refresh, the very model that CR calls ""the worst buy in the last decade"". Well, the only problem I had was the usual COMAND failure that everyone experienced and one HID bulb. 41,000 miles of everyday driving and that was it. No ABC/Air-suspension failures, A/C problems, no electrical grimlins(much unlike my '98 ls), noda..And to my '05 S65 AMG. Two new rear tires was all the maintenance it required for 10,000 miles of onwership. Of course the usual oil/lube and other MB/AMG stuff, but nothing out of the scheduled maintenance. And the tires were due to my over-zealous driving habits.So many people jump the gun about MB's and Bimmers being hugely unreliable. Take for instance Porsche. 10 years ago, it was thought to be nothing more than a weekend toy because of what people assumed to be unreliable. Now it's the most reliable company in the biz, hands down....Despite it's many sophisticated electronic devices, trick suspension, AWD, complicated powertrain, and precious construction, I have not had not one issue with my a8 W12. Yes it's very German, but very reliable, not something I can say about the two Japanese ls's I've owned, but again, case by case experience. Not all are complete lemons just like not all will be as reliable as advertised....."
"""By the way the new GS, next lsand new $150K sports car are all Italian designs.Do you know the designer because every article says these were designed by Lexus in Japan, especially that sports car concept.  The GS itself started out as an Italian design in 1993, and has since been altered greatly.  Lexus is working with an Italian designer, I read that somewhere, but the cars you're seeing now the GS and that sports car concepts aren't of Italian design, if they are thats most unfortunate.  The next lsmight be though. All luxury car brands are highly reguarded, at least the ones we discuss on this board, doesn't mean there won't be price resistance. Every brand has their limits. I'll believe a 600hp Lexus sedan when I see it.  I hardly see Toyota approving such a car with such a pointless amount of horsepower. M"
"""Come now, does anyone really believe that whatever price difference there is between the A8 and LexusLS, that that price difference accounts for the lsselling 5.4 TIMES as many units (U.S., cy2004)?  ? Nope, no one said that price is the sole factor, only that is but one factor in sales, especially with the SClass and 7Series.  The A8 especially the swb model is much closer to the LexusLS in price than either the S or 7Series.  Of course there are many other factors as to why the A8 doesn't sell compared to the LexusLS or even SClass and 7Series.  Audi's rep isn't in the same league as Mercedes, BMW or Lexus at this level of the market in most buyers minds and then there is Audi's bad reliability rep, which was never good in the first place, and I think a lot of people really get scared when they hear that the A8 is made of aluminum, and lastly I've heard this myself countless times at Audi dealer, autoshows and such....""for that money I may as well get the Benz"".   ?M"
"The success of the LexusES does prove that, at least in the US market, the LexusES is unbeatable. In Europe though, its a completely unsellable car. Agree with the first part.  Not sure about the second part.  The RX is doing incredibly well in UK.  Lexus has only just arrived in Europe as a brand identity distinct from Toyota, starting from UK."
"Which still didn't amount to beating their competitors from BMW and Mercedes. Period. Neither IS nor GS were intended to beat 3, 5, C or E on their own.  IS and GS were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars.  LexusES and RX competed against 325, 525, C240, C280, E320 and their wagon variants; IS and GS competed against 3Series , 530i, 545i, C320, and E500.  If anything, one might make the argument that BMW and MB copy each other's product lineups, replete with almost one-on-one sedan and wagon offerings,  whereas Lexus took quite a different route. The CLS competitors are rumored and upcoming, Is that your way of backtracking what you said earlier??  But you are the one spreading the ""rumors,"" whether that rumor has any substance or not. AMG vs M? What does that have to do with anything? AMG is obviously an MB attempt to copy the success BMW's M division.  They compete for the similar clientelles; just look at the numerous comparos.  Your argument splitting hair about AMG using AMG and force-induction therefore it's not copying M division is laughable . . . by that logic, Lexus never copied anyone because it packed more electronics, electronics that actually worked, into their cars.  Get real. None of these cars compete in this space so why bring them up?  Of course these cars about ride over handling.  In case you did not notice, that's the direction lsis headed.  Much of SClass sales worldwide are to fleets; the drivers are often not owners Problem is you just skirted over the issue when it comes someone trying to build an Lexus LexusLS. NO ONE IS. Lexus spends their time trying to build a Mercedes SClass and now (according to some, not necessarily me) a 7Series. There is no point for anyone else to make an lsexcept for Lexus; nor anyone to make an SClass except MB; nor anyone to make a 7 except for BMW.  However, if you can make a better lsthan Lexus, or better S than MB, or better 7 than BMW, and still be able to sell with a competitive value proposition, you have a business plan.  The reality is that, nobody in their right mind dares to even try making a better lsthan Lexus.  The same can not be said of S (or CLS, like you said ealier)."
"..but I wonder how many employees are secure enough to take that approach...Sadly, in this day and age of job insecurity, not many would. How would David Ogilvy sell Mercedes? Same way as the current ad agency - play up the styling and never mention anything remotely linked to its heritage or its features. When the  SClass gets here, I am sure the ad would play up the new styling and the HP, not the heritage. Methinks if you have 116+ years of heritage, why not flaunt it ? Remind everyone what it means to be owning such a premium brand.... In MBs defense, I suspect Lexus would probably do same for the new lsas well....BTW, anyone remember the car in the ad where a guy in a butler suit arranges lots of wine glasses pyramid-like on the hood of the car while the engine was running, to show how truly quiet the car was ? I think that was just spectacular ad, and well done too.  Such an ad will do better than just playing on people's ego and envy of their neighbor. Talking of neighbors, the lady across from my house just bought a new ES330 . I asked her why she bought the LexusES. Her answer: ""I wanted a Lexus and all my friends liked the LexusES so I bought one"" She had no clue as to any attributes of the car she just paid $40K for. Of course, with 5 cars in the garage, she has more $$$ to flaunt. A perfect candidate for an MB, if you ask me...."
"""Do you think that if Mercedes went back to their former style that Lexus ""copied"" they would sell a lot more cars.""I'm not sure actually.  I think design wise they've never been better with the exception of the CLK and Maybach.  Neither of those cars ""look"" like they should imo.  I also think the SClass could stand a few less frivolous details like on the sides and hood, but overall Mercedes seems to be at the top of their game design wise.   This statement is pending me actually seeing the CLS mind you.   Their old style probably wouldn't sell today unless they brought back everything that went along with those designs.  You know like the hefty build and much better reliability, you know the stuff that made the legend in the first place.    For them to just go back to stodgy designs without the corresponding jump in quality wouldn't work, again imo.  If they did both then heck yeah it would work, but they'd sell a lot less cars.   Good question. Also, if people buying Lexuses think that they are the ultimate then people buying MB, BMW and others think those brands are the ultimates also.   Overall image still goes to the Germans, no matter how slight or fleeting that advantage may be to Lexus owners.  Until Lexus does some, what I like to call gee-whiz cars and a 100K+ car they simply don't have the image here and especially on the worldwide scene. oac,?You're confused about Mercedes-Benz's models.   The ""C-Class"" does not comprise the CLK or CL.  The CLK is a 50K+ machine and the CL is a 100K+.  The CLK is based on the C-Class sedan chassis, but its sales aren't counted in with the C-Class.  The CL is a large coupe based on theSClass, it has nothing to do with the C-Class at all.   If you think the 50K+ CLK Coupe/Convertible and 100K and up CL Coupe are supposed to even contend with a 33K ES330 Sedan (in the heart of the market) for sales you're completely lost on how the market works. The SClass being down on sales means what?   The car came out in the Spring of 1999 as MY2000 car and is now the oldest car in this class.   It had a record year in 2000 and in 2003, which were its introduction and face-lift years.   The lshas and will do the same thing for 2001 and 2004.  These are normal market trends, yet you continue to hype this as type of abnormality or crisis.   The Lexus GS has literally fallen of the sales charts for the same reasons, it's old.   Is that a crisis or just a normal model progression over time? Lexus sales more cars because they have a cheaper overall lineup.  I don't know why this has been so hard to grasp on this board.   Lexus' core cars are between 33-55K, and they are the LexusES, RX, GS, IS and GX.   This same price spread will only get you a C-Class, CLK320, M-Class, SLK or E320 at a Mercedes-Benz store.   It is so obvious that you haven't ever looked at 1) a MB sales chart or 2) the price configurator at the MB site.   They have 25 models that start around 50K (E320 48K) and up, compared to 12 that are priced under 50K.  The sales advantage will likely always be Lexus'. That plus the fact that Lexus has the most efficient dealership setup in the industry (which is Lexus' competitor's problem, not Lexus') equals more sales.  I've always stated the Lexus had the greatest dealership setup.  Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar have had some of the same dealers for 40 years and it is hard to get such and entrenched group (read stubborn) to change their ways.   Mercedes actually lost about 80 dealerships in the late eighties and early nineties when sales hit an all time low of about 60K units in 1993.  In Southern Cal there are way too many dealerships in some cases right on top of each other and for years they've all been able to sell enough cars to make each one of them viable.  Same situation Florida.  Huge markets.  I bet Lexus has far fewer dealerships in these areas, but no doubt sells more cars though each one. All this crisis talk based on sales is so ridiculously funny because in 1993 Mercedes sold a little over 61K cars and they had way more dealers then, but now they move over 200K a year.  You Lexus guys missed the real crisis as far as sales are concerned! Also..the new SLK will make a huge difference once it goes on sale.  The SLK will be in the 40-50K range and is set to dominate the class until the next Porsche Boxster comes along, going by the press reviews so far.  Of course the 190K (projected) CL and SClass 65 models aren't going to sell more than a couple hundred units a year.  These are prestige or halo cars only.  The 450K SLR will also sell in the 200-300 unit range per year, hardly a spec on the sales chart.  The CL SClass will add somewhere between 5-8K units a year.  MB's biggest sellers are the C andEClass (small and medium sedans just like BMW or Audi) followed by the ML, CLK, S and SClass models in any given year. Mercedes unlike all the rest also has a large group of cars at their top end to which no one else (except BMW in same cases) has an answer for.  The MB sales picture will always be somwhat different.

"""How 'bout Jaguar, Phaeton, Acura, Ferrari, AM, etc... And your favorite, Maserati Q... Maybe more details on these cars later as they come to you ???  ? Well for those see the earlier Detroit review I guess, there really wasn't anything new for those brands at Chicago.  The Phaeton and cousin a8 remiain my favorites in the segment, especially their repsective W12, 4-seater versions.  Awesome.  Oh! That Jaguar Lightweight Coupe Concept is awesome, but like I said before (I think somewhere) it kinda looks like a junior Aston-Martin, which is no bad thing in my book.  There are much worse looking cars out there to imitate.  The Maserati Quattroporte like the A8 has an optional all wooden steering wheel. I mean the entire wheel is wood and it is tacky and could be dangerous when sweaty hands are grasping to make that crucial turn.  I'm surprised at Audi which always considered wooden steering wheels to be a tacky American car thing.  Thats about all that has ""come"" to me since....  ? M"
"""I don't understand what Audi is going to do yet......""You and I both. Prior to the release of the Q7 on our shores, Audi said that the Q7 would be available in the following sequence: the 4.2 V-8, followed in the fall by the 3.6L V-6, and then a V-10 "" 50 state compliant-clean"" TDI. Now they say that the 5.0L V-10 will be in short supply because the Toureag will take most of the orders and with Porsche contemplating a TDI/hybrid model of the hot Cayenne(no pun intended  :P ), so hence the release of the less torquey(""only 395lb-ft"") V-6 version, already on sale in Euro markets, and elsewhere. I don't see this engine making the NA cut either to satisfy we power hunger Americans. It's likely that the Audi will be paired with the V-10 TDI because the hybrid versions are years off because of development/production delays. It's likely the hybrids won't get here until the new for '09 A8 gets here to compete head-on with the LS600hL if Lexus holds true to what the car will be, V-8/hybrid/AWD technology. BTW, I don't know if you knew or not, but VW/Audi and MB execs met with the EPA and DOT to discuss and finalize the approval on the Bluetec and TDI engines. My guest is they had to assure them that these engines are what they say they are. But surely the agencies will conduct in-house testing to certify they are. Funny how they can inprove emissions tests, which is well needed, but they can't improve or invent new ways of measuring fuel economy. Oh and the old CAFE increases are just a cute way of getting out of it. Why? Why? Why?$200k FOR AN S65 AMG????? WHAT?????  :mad:  Can we all say Flying Spur, which is faster at the same price. To go from 170 to 200k is flat out ridiculous. Very dangerous territory. And I was crying over the 160k that I laid out for my S65. Price increase of 30-fold, huh? So the S63 is looking even better know.    :P"
"""I'll bet most critics of an LexusLS have never sat behind the wheel of one.  I'll also bet that many LexusLS buyers have owned MB E or SClass cars before. Do I have statistics - no. Just my feeling because it's the situation with the people I know and I'd bet its representative of a large part of the buying group.""You might be right on that because most German car folk have read too much about the car being an isolation chamber and more importantly just looking at the thing is most off-putting so I doubt many would bother.  However on this board, most of the negative noise about Mercedes comes not from former MB owners but survey and graph chasers and folk who couldn't ""fit"" into a Mercedes.  Reading some of their posts its obvious they don't have a clue as to what a Mercedes was or is about today.   The same could also be said about the Lexus owners who talk down about Audi and BMWs, most of them wouldn't and haven't gone near one to even know what they're talking about.  Especially the Audi detractors.  I think the friction comes in when someone on either side tries to say what defines a luxury car, while knocking a car they've never even driven, and know they don't want the other car anyway...for whatever reasons. Yes I have driven the LexusLS, but it was a 2002 model.  I've driven a used 2001 model also, so I haven't driven the 2004 model.  The Carconnection review still hints that it is still too isolated from the road, and others have said that very same thing about the 2004 models so I have my doubts about this ""far tighter"" claim you're making.  The same press that praises the LS' other attributes says the same thing about the 2004 model as they do the 2001 model, it doesn't have the dynamic or feel/roadholding of the German cars.   The 2001-2003 models drove like a Buick to me especially when mildly pushing it.  Way too much body roll.   What you and other Lexi never seem to get is that nobody is saying the  SClass is a ""drivers car"" in the purest sense, only that it is more of a drivers car than a LexusLS.  It feels more connected to the road than the LexusLS.  I've seen a many of post from lsowner talking about how they felt nothing when driving, meaning it was smooth, that isn't what most German car buyers look for, at least the ones that buy for technical not status.   The only true ""drivers car"" in this segment is a 7Series (short wheelbase) with the sport package or maybe the A8L, haven't driven it yet. Yeah audibob was being ridiculous to say the least, and I'm crazy about Audi so imagine me reading stuff about Audi that even I couldn't sell here. michael_mattox, What I said to Lenn above applies to your post about the Allante.  You never even drove the SClass and because you didn't fit into it very well it was a lesser car.  Wow very astute analysis. The Allante was junk plain and simple.  Nobody bought them and even the normally big-mouthed Cadillac would like to forget about the car.   You're a big fan of sales when it comes to Lexus but when it comes to Cadillac you don't mention sales?  The car was a flop and everyone knows it.  The 1990 SClass only sealed the coffin the fwd, underpowered Allante already put itself in from the start.  It was a second car for most so who cared about how well it was made or how reliable it was?  Are you serious?  That is a complete stack of bs.   Fact: in the early 90's Mercedes lead your precious surveys, where was Cadillac.   I see where you're coming from now.  Surveys and sales to tout Lexus, but not for Cadillac.   I've never seen a non-GM owner/fan come up with so many excuses for one of their worst products in history.  What you say about the top alone is just far too surreal to be coming from a Lexus owner.  Would you buy a SC430 if it had a manual cloth top and that only half-arsed worked?  Heck no.  How much more hypocritical can you be about the Allante. designman, I'll have to find the article.  I think they stated the #1 selling configuration for the 911 was the C2 with an auto, not the C4S.  The article went on to say that Porsche was semi-worried about this. M"
"""I'm afraid that is true of a lot of cars so why does any one car get singled out.""Are you serious?  You don't know why the lsgets ""singled out""?  Because no other car in this class looks like a previous version of their competitor.  If you don't see this then you're not being honest with yourself.   The A8, XJ, 7, S and Phaeton all wear their own unique styling, only the lslooks like a knock off of something else.  To say that the lslooking like the previous S to imply that a lot of cars look alike is a grand (denial) excuse at best.  That simply isn't true in this class of cars. maxhonda99, Sometimes it is best to not even respond to such ridiculousness, especially when they can't get the sales numbers right to begin with.  This has been the case before, rhetoric based on sales figures that weren't even checked before posting.  I wonder if they even looked at the sales months listed on that link they provided.   Complete lost cause. M"
"""I'm comparing top end Acura (Legend before, RL now) to theSClass, LexusLS, 7Series, A8 etc. That's where it falls short.""If power is a priority then sure it falls short. But it's right up there with luxury amenities. Pure luxury starts with plush, cushy, quiet, rife with features. On the high end throw in enough room for people who've had one Sicilian slice too many. It's there and power is adequate. It gets the short end of the stick because we are in the throes of a power war and consciousness. Keep an eye on this new AWD system. AWD is nothing new but regardless it is still in it's infancy. What will distinguish it in the future is performance. The real legacy of electronics in cars is performance-enhancing electronics. In the animal kingdom four-legged creatures outperform their two-legged counterparts by a wide margin. The task for engineers is to figure out how to efficiently apply and optimize power to four wheels in a similar manner, a fairly complex collaboration among engineering disciplines and one which does not lend itself to immediacy. But when people start to notice AWD in warm climates you'll know it has really arrived. The RL could be the first of significant steps forward in this area. This is an innovative move.As much as I consider the RL a high end luxury car, I will admit wondering why Acura doesn't answer the V8 call just on the principle of demand which I believe starts with bandwagon luxury buyers buying into the beating the RL relentlessly takes on this issue in the press. Too much attention is paid to categories. But it could behoove them financially if they just acquiesce, losing the tweener image in the process and beating the ""big boys"" at their own game. They certainly appear have the ability and marketing savvy but with the RL and NSX you have to scratch your head at times."
"""I've always been curious about something, why cant the Germans manage to put in-dash CD changers in their cars? That is something that Nissan and Honda were doing 10 years ago, and yet just recently Audi managed to actually put one in a few of its cars, and cars that just came out like the Taureg still have it shoved in the trunk. Whats up with that?""I'm going to surprise you and the board here, but Lenn probably remembers my positon on this from a few years back.........its pure arrogance and dissmissive behavior and/or the U.S. arms of the German luxury makers not having their parent's full attention in Germany.  I've said for years they need to start tailoring their cars more to the US market when it comes to details like that. Mercedes-Benz has one available in the 2003+EClass, but not on any other product.   For years Mercedes-Benzes didn't have any in-dash CD players in any of their cars.  The 2003SClass, CL and SClass were the first ones to offer this along with the 2003EClass that has a single+ 6CD changer.   Amazingly, astonshingly, help me out here...the 2004 C-Class, CLK and SLK still don't have an in-dash CD player of any type.  The 2005 C-Class now has a single in-dash CD player.  The 2005 CLK gets one as does the new 2005 SLK so Mercedes has managed to still come up behind the Japanese cars in this regard.  Go figure. Most BMWs have a single slot CD player now with a changer either in the glovebox or somewhere else, I honestly forget.   The most perplexing case is Audi.  For 2004 all of their cars had a standard in-dash 6-disc CD player, but for 2005 they are going back in the glovebox!   They did this is the name of style in the A8 I think and simply because the new A6's interior is so cluttered, a complete reversal of the 1998-2004 A6's interior. The CL600 - ""That much horsepower in a 2.5 ton car is just dangerous and stupid.""So when Lexus does it with the oh-so-often-hyped-upcoming LSClassGT (Car and Driver saySClasshp at least) it will be just as stupid and dangerous right?   Where do we draw the line, 400, 500 or 600??  I guess wherever Lexus tops out at will be repectable and prudent.  Please don't let me down by saying yes to that. ljflx, ""merc1 - you read so much into the power issues. The comments always were that with cars that go 0-60 in 6 seconds on 290-320HP and with great torque - why is there a ""real"" need for anything more. We are talking main stream cars here not exotic specialty cars. We also were saying pour the investment money into things that produce a better and safer car rather than even more excess  power. Need should have a higher priority than excess. In the big cities wherte 90% of these cars are sold you can't use that power very often anyway. What percent of MB's or BMW's sold do you think have 400-600HP. Maybe 5% and that is a real stretch. So to portray that power as brand representation is one heck of a statistical flaw.""Ok I'm trying to follow all of that double talk.  First off, nobody said or portrayed that 400-600hp models represent anything even close to a majority of BMWs or Mercedes sold, where you got that from I don't know.   Basically what you're saying otherwise is that 400+ hp is pretty much useless right?  If so why is a rumored 500hp Lexus L SClass (a sedan not a specialty car) hyped like the second coming of the automobile?  BTW, it doesn't take much money to develop more power in most cases. It is hardly a big resource drain. "" Now it's amazing to me to hear that the majority of Lexus buyers are people who can't wait for a survey to come in the mail and answer them.""Stay with me here, I meant on this board sir.  Please lets not get into comments we wish we could take back from other posters.   Where did anyone try to defeat or dispute Lexus' reliability?  What one is allowed speculate in favor of Lexus and others aren't when it comes to how people fill out surveys?  Come on now. michael_mattox, You mean to tell me they have both a radar-based and a laser-based cruise control system on offer at the same time?  Didn't know that.  Doesn't make much sense either if that is true, I don't know.  I do know that a radar-based system is superior.   You'll love this...on some Sundays I check out the lots here and the Lexus dealer here is moving to a new location (read bigger) and he has not a single LexusLS or any type on his lot,  not a one.   Plenty of SC430s and GX470s but no lss.   Business is good in luxurycarland. M"
"""If you, Merc1, can find a BMW cue in the new IS, kindly share it with us. I don't see any. Of course, I could have my blinders on.""I think you just might.  You are kidding about German car fans not giving Lexus their props right considering the last few pages of posts here right?  Anyway it really wasn't a diss against Lexus as you put it.  I just said they look similar, now if you consider that outright copying then thats your view, I didn't use the word copy because I don't think it fits here.  Whether you'll ever accept it or not Lexus does have a habit of making some of their cars look like the car they think is the number one target.   I find the IS to be way more attractive than the GS actually.  The GS looks like some sort of whale to me.  The GS is badly proportioned and way to thick in the rear/side treatment to be good looking, imo. What difference does it make whether or not BMW did put out a concept vehicle or not?  At least BMW, when they do release a concept bring something to market that looks like the concept.  Lexus has yet to do anything even close to their concepts and the new IS surely isn't nearly as ugly as that LF-C or whatever that concept was at Detroit last year.  Not the sports car concept, but the sedan one they did last year too, the GS didn't come close to looking as good as that sedan concept, lf-a/s/e/de whatever it was.  BMW did too put out a concept for the X3, and guess what the production X3 looked just like the concept, unlike Lexus' goofy concepts which don't translate into anything production.   Lexus in particular seems clueless about what concept cars are supposed to do, preview a product.  Even Acuras concepts for the RL and TL are closer than Lexus' to their production RL and TL. Also, Mercedes and BMW usually only put out concepts for a totally new vehicle, not an update of an existing vehicle.  Unlike Lexus, Mercedes in particular doesn't need concepts to debut a new styling direction, and neither does BMW (regardless of whether you like their new look or not).  Mercedes has put out the GST (R-Class) and Vison B (B-Class).  BMW put out concept for the all new 6-Series (Z9) and the X3 before launch also so you're incorrect about them not having put out any concepts.  There is no need for a concept to preview the new SClass or 3Series because they are established cars in their respective markets.  Most carmakers use concepts to introduce the public to a totally new product or to drum up interest for a lackluster one already on the market.  Hence Lexus' concepts for their GS and IS models, bet you won't see a concept for the next LexusLS. BTW, I happen to like what I've seen of the new IS so far, that doesn't mean it is original looking, imo of course.  I'm not the only one that has said this about the IS. M"

As to the SC, I am no fan but at only 13 days on dealer lot before it gets sold, its a winner for Lexus. The new GS came earlier than anticipated, with old carryover motors (4.3L V8), and a new but underpowered 245HP V6. Certainly Lexus looks to amend these with the GS350 and the GS450h. As to beating a 5Series, Lexus is NOT a performance-inclined company, thus far. Their forte is luxury, refinement, solid build quality and reliability. Infiniti comes close to matching BMW in the handling and performance areas, and so far are doing a heck of a job. But where is Infiniti in the large luxury sedan class ? Methinks the HELM plays to Lexus' strength, that is why it was easy for the lsto assume the #1 sales crown within such a relatively small timeline.And now, the company is marching in the right path. With cars like the new ES350 and IS350(but still no 6-speed(yet), which are great entries, the company can finally put up a good fight. Late? A decade and half.Lexus or Toyota can certainly put MTs in their cars. After the 2002 release of the IS300 5-MT, with no appreciable uptick in sales or interest, Lexus was wise to stick to its strength in the gen-2 release... The new IS350, even with a slushbox, outruns any in its class. BTW, do I not tote around town in a 6-MT Matrix ? That little buzzy car is fun to drive, and its all Toyota drivetrain and with a Yamaha motor rated at  100hp/L of displacement, and priced under $20K !!! What a deal ! Designman, take note: not all Lexophiles drive around in snoozemobiles... Sorry I digress A decade and a half, is all Lexus' history compared to the 100+ for MB, Audi and others... What do you expect ? Perfection ??? For its short lifespan, Lexus has achieved a level unheard of in automotive history. And the sky is the limit. The LexusES killed off every competition in its path. Ditto the RX, setting the bar for what a luxury car-based SUV should be. The LX continues its remarkable run on a solid LC platform, old as it is.... These are Lexus winners anyway you slice it....Talking of late to the party, how late was BMW and Audi to the SUV party ? How late are they to the hybrid party ? How late are they to the 8-speed tranny party ? How late are they to creating an ergonomic cupholder in their lux cruisers ? How late are they to simple, touchscreen DVD-based Nav ? Oh, don't tell me these things are unimportant, cos they are, otherwise MB, BMW and Audi won't have these in their cars as well.Doc put it best: how high does Toyota/Lexus want to go before pissing off our politicians in DC ? That, I submit, is Lexus/Toyota's achilles' heel !"
"""It's a 50-50 lease/buy relationship. Where I live it's more like 80-20 in favor of lease but I've read it's 50-50 many times as a whole in the US. As for the A8 - there are people that wouldn't take the car if you put a 40% discount on one. You can count me as one. I'm not sure I'd take it if you gave it to me because it would cost me 44% in taxes. I have no desire whatsoever for an A8, trust me on that one. Just watch A8 sales plummet in the next two years. The car has no staying power. Within 3 or 4 years it's not easy to resell an SClass or an A8 because demand is so low for used ones. Even MB diehards don't trust the electronics and long-term ownership of the cars particularly after 3 years. The E and S threads are loaded with comments like that.  ? None of this past your 50/50 example has anything to do with price and sales, which was my point.  If there is 50/50 buy/lease rate in the U.S. then that 50 percent that buyers may or may not be deterred by the price difference, thats my point.  Especially considering the LexusLS doesn't sticker or sell at the SClass and 7Series' base price.   ? M"
"""Let's not forget that Toyota is #2 in worldwide sales with 7.5M cars and trucks sold in FY2004, and threatens GM's 9.1M worldwide sales. There is no DCX or BMW close to Toyota in WORLDWIDE brand recognition. Should we mention market cap, since Toyota is higher than its competition combined. If I were BMW or MB, would I be calling out a company that strong in every facet of the car business ???? Just arrogance, IMO.I honestly don't know what you're talking about.  BMW's CEO was asked about Lexus and he responded. He in no way ""called"" Lexus out.  He told the truth about Lexus' situation in Europe. He even said that he welcomed the competition.  Did you miss that part?  All that babble about Toyota's profits and their quality we've heard time and time again and it really doesn't do a thing for a ""car"" guy like me.  I couldn't care any less personally. I like design, performance, styling etc., you know the things that deal with the actual car.""Add to the fact that BMW's highest sales comes from non-luxury cars.... tons of diesel-/gas-powered stripped 3Series in Europe. Ditto MB, where they find most work as ""sherpas"". Here in the NA market where they are considered *luxury* marques, they are way back of sales to Lexus. Granted Lexus sells more SUVs, but doesn't MB and BMW sell more low-end (suspect) lux cars here in the US anyway ? The 3- and C-class being sales leaders for BMW and MB, respectively.What difference does any of this make, whats the point?  For one in Europe if Lexus is going to be successful they will have to offer a low end diesel, and they are.  The new IS will have a 4-cylinder diesel model just like all those MBs and BMWs you like to rag on.  Lexus isn't going to be any different.  One of the biggest reasons why they've been nothing more than an afterthought in Europe is just that - lack of diesels. Further more, do you have the sales numbers or breakout for all these non-luxury BMWs that you claim BMW makes their way on?  If you look at the worldwide sales numbers BMW would probably squash Lexus even if you took out the lower end cars you claim aren't luxury cars.  The only that is really cheap is the 1Series and it isn't trying to be a ""luxury car"" especially in the sense that a dull, boring Lexus is.  Its a drivers car and has won praise all over Europe for being just that.  If the 3Series diesels isn't a luxury car you'd better let Lexus know about this because they're going to put a 4-banger diesel in the IS to compete with BMW, not the other way around. How is MB and BMW selling 3Series and C-Class cars ""suspect"" in America? You seem to be reaching for something that isn't there.  The 3Series and C-Class being sales leaders is common sense, the cheapest products are the best selling ones at nearly every luxury brand in the U.S. The 325i and C230 Sedan should count because they are around 30K?  The C-Coupe models are gone.  The ES330 and RX are Lexus' best sellers and one is highly ""suspect"" in being a re-worked Camry that no one else really competes with, if you want to call a C-Class/3Series ""suspect"".  I don't understand what the debate or point is here.  Are you saying Mercedes and BMW aren't luxury brands?  Mercedes in particular has no trouble selling cars that cost anywhere from 3 or 5 times what any Lexus costs, that is the true measure of a luxury brand.  Lexus wants this same ability and worlwide clout like really bad. Hence their upcoming push in Europe.  I'm glad you finally see that Lexus' sales are based on trucks not their domination of the car market.  The only one of their cars that is truly a hit in their segment is the LexusLS.  Nobody from Japan or Germany is rushing to build a ES330 competitor, the ultimate blue-hair set car.  Lincoln is the only one. ""So when we talk GLOBAL, BMW should not be throwing stones at Lexus. Lexus was Toyota and we all know who is more global between BMW and Toyota, don't we?""Apples to Oranges.  BMW is a luxury brand, Toyota isn't.  Globally Lexus isn't anything to even mention, yet, hence the BMW's CEO's comments.  Though I have yet to read where he threw any stones.  You can't have it both ways.  One minute its all about Lexus then the next its Toyota.  Is Lexus seperate or not?  Toyota sells more stripped down models than BMW does, by millions. BMW doesn't build fwd cars or pickups or inexpensive SUVs so to compare the two corporately is a little bogus.  Toyota, the brand doesn't even build anything close to a BMW at what a BMW does.  BMW had either one of their best, if not the best year ever last year also, sales and profit wise.  Unless you have Lexus' figures seperate of Toyota then this is just more hype. Being ""global"" at the very least should mean dominating your home market, which Lexus wasn't even a brand name until like this year.  Didn't you post upon your return from Japan that your business associates confirmed that BMW and Mercedes enjoy a higher level of status in Japan?  How you can even think or talk global when you're not #1 on your home turf.  Mercedes and BMW rule Germany, with a Audi looking to knock both of them off, no mention of Lexus.  Yes Toyota is global, but so is BMW but BMW and Toyota don't compete model for model, Lexus and BMW do. Shifting the tiptronic here.........I took a look at the GS per your request. First off, the car is a lot smaller looking on the lot than it was on the auto show stand, a lot smaller.  I wasn't ready for that.   The car has too much wheelbase and some very out of place curves/lines to be attractive.  The interior is bordering on bare like the German cars of old, especially in the black interior example I saw.  Then there is the big plank of a center console that looks like it belongs in a LexusLS, not a supposed to be sports sedan like the GS. Remember all imo.  Me no likey at all.  The Infiniti M is more attractive exterior wise, but I think I still might like the GS' interior better, not sure. ""They will compete with BMW not by being the best handling and balanced car, but by being a good handling and performance car in the Lexus way - quiet, smooth, refined, well-built and luxurious in and out. That is: be like BMW yet remain a Lexus true-and-true.You better hope it drives better than it looks because the previous GS was all these things and bombed.  BMW's have verve and connection at the controls that no Lexus has had so far, and if this is the premise then this GS will be forgotten too.  If you want BMW you have to wear the sport theme on your chest, arm and back like the Infiniti M does.  Thats the BMW competitor. M"
"""Likely much ado about nothing if the prices LJ gave hold up. There is no reason to think they won't as they seem logical to me for a car as upgraded as the LS460 is compared to the LexusLS.

Steve modified his argument at some point from the lsbeing priced at S levels to now being priced at A8 and 750LI levels. The initial and only real argument here was about the former and never the latter. The prices I was quoted have shown that the latter is where the car will be pegged. So Steve's rants are there simply for the point of ranting. We've shown agreement on price here - for a long time now - and he doesn't even seem to realize it. One can never go purely by MSRP anyway as one mfr. may have items standard that others have as options. But Steve doesn't ever take this into consideration.IDOL - what's your take? Who really becomes the biggest star? All 5 finalists can be stars and I personally thought Taylor was the weakest of the 5. He won on his (Seinfeld's) Elaine-like dancing and personality. My bet is Chris gets into a band and that Paris, Katherine and Elliot outshine Taylor long-term."
"""MB has certainly innovated in 120 years far more than Lexus has in 15. The more relevant question imho is how innovation compares over the past 5, 10, or 15 years, and given the importance of hybrid to the industry the answer is less clear.""This is where you and I will have to agree to disagree because you keep mentioning one thing - hybrids.  While being a major innovation, it is but one innovation.   ""MB has more safety features but I have yet to see anyone convincingly demonstrate that this outweighs the safety impact of MB's reliability issues. For instance, how many people have died due to the SC's lack of rollbars, vs how many have died due to MB's brake reliability issues?""I'm sorry this to be ridiculous because there is no widespread case of either MB's safety equipment not working or anyone getting killed by a Lexus not having a roll bar.  The point is what at least Mercedes does have the safety equipment in place.  Yes it works.  You can find isolated incidents about any make or model under the sun, just like I did about the  RX  in a previous post.  It is being investigated for brake failures.   The fact remains airbags, roll over protections, ABS and others work as advertised almost all of the time, no car is perfect though.  These things have been adopted by the entire industry, yet Mercedes is implied to be the only one that has a problem with them.   There are other brands that score even worse in the precious surveys, yet I see no one here saying that their most basic safety equipment doesn't work.  This is a bogus claim. I meant 0-60 times in general, not the same old LexusLS vsSClass.  I mean when one mentions cars like the E55 or SL55 and then we get the pointless gripes from the Lexus camp, yet when Lexus build a hi-po car it all becomes relevant because it will save some fuel.   Very hypocritical imo. Handling- yes it is better in a Benz, but I never said it was the ultimate thing, otherwise I'd want a BMW. M"
"""merc1 - couldn't agree with you more on the MB and Rolls analogy. MB is a reliability issue and that's all. They are still in the lead or very near the top in advancing the industry, whereas Rolls went into a rip van winkle sleepfest. In fact the latter - trying to maintain that #1 position in development - is part of the cause of their reliability problems. Another part may simply be systematic to all of europe. I have seen some consulting reports that simply state the current group of European workers (in all industries) are simply not up to snuff with the people they are replacing.""As almost always...well put, and of course I agree.   There is a artist sketch of the 2006 CL at germancarfans.com.  Unlike the nextSClass, the next CL will be a stunner if they come anywhere close to this sketch. ""merc1 - You need to get Mercedes back into this. Lexus vs. BMW can't hold a candle to Lexus vs. Mercedes. There's not enough cross-shoppers and the two brands - as you stated so well -play to different crowds.""Nope, I can't help livinbmw with the points he has chosen to argue with, and I don't think we need to go back over Mercedes vs Lexus. I think everyone knows where I, you, and everyone else stands on that one.  I tried to tell everyone that the BMW vs Lexus thing isn't really comparable past a few common luxury car points, like 70 posts ago.  I find this debate to be really boring to, BMW and Lexus are opposites in too many areas to give the debate some legs.  BMW fans will never, ever accept a LexusLS type car, and vice versa.   Lexus long ago aligned itself much closer to Mercedes' way of thinking, engineering etc. etc. not BMW's. Now if the Q45 had the following of the LexusLS then you'd have a more even matched debate because Infiniti is really the one after BMW in the sport arena and they did bill the Q45 as a sporty sedan much like the 7Series, but the car has been a huge flop so there aren't any owners around to take up the debate. Like I've stated long ago, BMW really hasn't had to worry about Lexus nearly as much as Mercedes has had to because of their sport bent.  The Lexus vehicles that were aimed in BMW's  direction, the GS and IS just didn't make a dent and BMW has Acura and more importantly Infiniti to worry about.  Will this list include Lexus when the new GS and much more importantly the next IS comes out?  We'll see.  LexusLS vs 745i, forget it.  I personally would take a SClass, A8L, or XJ over both of them. M"
"""merc1 - you should note that an SClass is no longer much more expensive than an LexusLS in its popular trim - as topspin noted - and the Lexus still easily outsells it. The 7 is even closer or about the same price, less in the case of the LexusLS ultra, and it is also badly outsold.""If everyone leased then you'd have a point.  Secondly the SClass and  SClass sell *about* equally. The 7Series and SClass are still more expensive, especially when someone isn't leasing. M"
"""For MB, US sales position have changed from #1 to almost #4."" They managed to get to number 1 for one year, what in 1999 or 1998???  They did this on the back of the ML SUV which back then was a big deal for Mercedes-Benz because they never sold one here before.   One year at #1 because of SUV and they are supposed to maintain that momemtum and compete with a company that makes fifty percent of their sales on SUVs and the other 50 percent with much cheaper cars, mainly a 35K fwd model. Right. Dont' get me wrong here. I congratulate Lexus for their market success in the SUV area, the Germans are still clearly behind here.  Notice how I don't even dare suggest that this is Lexus' fault.  But how come if MB has increased sales each year since 1993 (from 60K to over 200K) in this country, with higher prices than everyone else, a 4.7 percent drop in 2004 is seen as the beginning of the end?   If anything with such a high priced lineup MB's market share grew in proportion to what could be reasonably expected of a brand with much higher priced cars, in other words they're going to always get a smaller share of the sales pie.  I wonder how many over 50K cars (still the bulk of their models) Mercedes has to sell compared to Lexus tearing up the under 50K segment with the LexusES and RX for sales to be a wash.   What am I thinking money is no object and sales are sales everyone can afford to buy-upwards. I wonder why Ferrari doesn't outsell Porsche or why Maybach doesn't outsell Bentley?  Price certainly couldn't have anything to do with this. M"
"""Now that the S350 is available at dealers, we won't have to scrounge around for sales data showing how it is selling vs the SClass.

The S350 is a last minue addition and isn't going to just soar past established models in the last 7-13 months of the currentSClass.  Mercedes didn't even tell anyone that the S350 was coming, heck I didn't even know until I checked their website.  They aren't even promoting the car, its a place holder.

No one posting here in favor of Mercedes has ever denied that they have some corporate and reliability problems.   ""Regardless, the new spy pictures of the new S looks terrible, and I will agree with Len here that the new style doesn't look as beautiful as the current S, and was something I was refering to in my previous post, that MB will try to over-compensate and screw things up even more. I guess, time will tell.""Yes time will tell because this is nothing more than hype imo, to draw a conclusion about a car you've never even seen before.  Spy photos really mean nothing until the finished product is shown.  All a spy photo can give is a general idea as to the shape and size of the car.  I'm sure you and Lenn will call the next S ugly either way because the current car is so good looking to the point of shaming the lsin that department so naturally you'd want the new one to stumble in that area.  Now that Lexus has come up with a lame styling theme L-finesse (yeah right) you've convinced yourself that the GS is a good looking car when its really nothing but a rework of the previous car with too much wheelbase and BMW hoff kink at the rear and yet poof new styling direction that gets killed by another Japanese car in the M35/45 let alone  EClass  or A6 in styling, of course IMO.

As far as sales go I expect Lexus, Mercedes, Audi and Infiniti post the biggest gains over the next 18 months or so due to all the new product they all have coming up.

"""Most buyers just want a mid-sized sedan with luxury interior appointment. ES330 delivers that in spades.""Brightness04?I'm not sure about those spades. A colleague of mine recently got an LexusES. Looks and feels very Toyota to me, not even close to suggesting the genes of the LexusLS. It doesn't seem to have the brand carryover that the Germans have in their lower end cars. Of course, I wished him luck and told him what a great car it was. His response? Ah-h-h it's a friggin' Toyota. Didn't feel like asking him why he spent the extra money. One thing about Lexus though. The service/reliability seems to be raising the bar with the other marques. I don't see how it can't. No doubt, the Japanese figure large in keeping the Germans in line. Who would have known what the Japanese would turn into after WWII. I remember distinctly the days  when ""Made in Japan"" was synonymous with rank cheap. Man has this changed. ""The RL has flopped in the marketplace so I'm done with it. Keep thinking it was compeitive with an SClass or anthing else for that matter. The car has been a complete dud.""Merc? I feel funny about harping on the RL, but I'll do it anyway. I think it flopped because too many people thought the price was too good to be true for the lux segment. I fail to see how the TL was so popular but the RL with so much more big-cruiser comfort wasn't, especially at a price difference which isn't nearly as extreme as jumping classes with the other marques. On HP it competes with the 5 and it has a pretty flat torque curve which means an ample supply on the low end. True, it could never compete with the 5 on handling, or the E or S with image. As far as the 4-speed AT, I'd like to know which buyers in the lux segment know the difference. That transmission just doesn't come into play for lux use, it's strictly a paper comparison. Bottom line: it just fell into a market-perception rut from which it couldn't escape? ""Gee, nobody's buying it, must be something wrong, I'm not taking that chance.""Now I have a confession. When I bought my 530, I lobbied heavily for the TL. My wife liked it also except for the size, so I then pushed the RL and I thought I had a sale. We both like Acuras and the discounts/bargaining opportunities were unbeatable. She drove just about everything out there and the decision looked close. Then she points out, we just have BMW left to test. I was trying to avoid this but couldn't since she is an avid CR reader. Just before she started up the 530 I told her, we might as well write the check now, this is the one you will love, this is the ride with which there is no equal, this is the one that will make you forget about our Volvos forever. Why the confession? It's quite simple. TL or RL would have meant extra cash for the self-indulged designman sports car fund. I had designs on a 911? settled on the Boxster S. Of course I wasn't sneaky about it? would have been too ridden with guilt. But her terse pragmatic response to my reasoning was? take a hike. Thus, RL never had a chance. But to this armchair critic it is probably the best lux bargain around. Too bad not too many know it. Funny thing about real bargains though, the reason they usually ARE bargains is because only a few know it.  :-)"
"""Sorry but it seemed to me that you had been disputing that. I guess now you're saying that if the difference is 14-20k or more, a higher priced vehicle can't outsell a lower priced one. Well, let's see what happens when we get some numbers on S350 sales vs  SClass sales, shall we? My guess is that the  SClass will outsell the S350. Or are you going to claim that MB stopped selling the S320 in this country because demand was too high?""You can re-word (spin) it as much as you like.  First it was the CLS/E/S vs the C-Class to make a point about sales now its wait until the S350 goes on sale and lets compare it to the SClass.  I mean really.  The simple fact is that you can't prove anything about prestige making up for higher sticker prices.  Who knows for sure as to why Mercedes stopped selling the S320, you and I surely don't so what the point?   The S350 is being added to a model line that is in its 6th year of production so I know that you realize that their are many other factors as to why it may or may not outsell the SClass, not just a price factor. ""it appears you have misunderstood what I am saying. I'm not saying that prestige is 10% or 100% or 200% as important a factor as price. I'm saying that we don't know how important it is. But my overall point is that imho one shouldn't endlessly repeat that MB's sales performance is due to high prices, when there is a factor out there (prestige) which can account for some (unknown) measure of the higher prices.""Then why are we debating this?   Who endlessly repeats that Mercedes sales performance is soley based on price?   I don't.  I've said from the beginning that price is but one factor in sales.  Go back and read my previous posts.  Also, I've never disputed that higher priced cars can outsell cheaper ones.  I've point that out with various MBs vs. various Lexuses for year.  You were the one that kept trying to say simply that prestige makes up for the price difference, which to me doesn't make any sense if the buyer can't afford a more expensive car to begin with.   If its an unknown measure (something I just said in my reply yesterday) then why are we debating it?   ""Fundamentally, we don't know how many buyers are 'priced' out of the market by MB (but can still afford Lexus). And we don't know how many buyers are 'prestiged' out of the market by Lexus' lack of prestige (relative to MB).""Again so what is the point?  We do know that not every single buyer of a say an lscan just jump to a SClass and/or especially an  SClass because of the price difference.  This is simply common sense to me, 14-20K is real.  Prestige is real to people who think that way.  I'm sure most think the S is more prestigious but how many can just pay an extra 14-20K more for one based on their beliefs instead of their wallets?""Every time an MB fan says something like ""it should be no surprise that MB undersells Lexus, what do you expect since its products are more expensive"" I could just as easily say ""lack of prestige vs MB hinders Lexus' sales, its pretty impressive that Lexus still manages to outsell MB"". But in fact both factors are at work, and it isn't and will never be clear which is the more important.""You could say that, but I could say that the bulk of MB's lineup is priced higher than Lexus'.  Once you past the C, ML, CLK, and E350/E500 MB's lineup costs way more than Lexus'. M"
"""That kinda does for the Audi line""I find that sticking a ""loser"" badge on the ENTIRE Audi line is just flat-out blasphemy. Take the A4, a great car with some class leading technology and available AWD, long before any carmaker in this field decided to start this. In fact, it has been quoted several times that Audi is the force behind carmakers offering AWD in the mid/high luxury car field. The FSi engines and DSG transmissions are years ahead of other direct injection and sequential shift(ie: BMW SMG, Maserati/Ferrari's F1, with there abrupt shift quality ) transmission.So in order to slap a ""loser"" sticker on a car, one would know what it takes to eventually become a loser. A car's merit shouldn't be based on how many we see on the road on a daily basis, but how well the car delivers on the promise told. And my A8 more than delivers. No other carmaker in the biz(Maybach, Bentley, RR, and Maser with-holding) delivers the craftsmanship and build quality of Audi, yes not even Lexus. It's this impeccable finish that drags me and 5500 other U.S. ""losers"" a year to buy an Audi A8. The car is such a loser, yet in fact, it remains on the best pick lists of many publications and European journals. Yes there are other very interesting entries in this arena. I for one am in love with the SClass, not so much so with the upcoming still-conservative LS460, altho it too will bring new technology and a first-ever LWB variant.But when Mercedes first released pictures of the SClass, people were quick to gawk in horror that they screwed up the world's premiere luxury car. But when it hit the streets and auto shows, the gawks turned into ooooosss and ahhhhhs, even more quickly. Is this car still a loser, or just because it's a Merc and will sell well, we can some how miraculously forgive it and put it in the winners circle??????"
"""That'd put a HUGE dent in the SClass sales, don't ya think?""A sizeble scratch, yes, but a dent?? I think that intially the lswill steal some sales from the S, but then when MB  introduce to our shores the S450, there will be some variance and some of the losses are due to return.This has been said every since the '92 S. Lexus sales slid with big and bold S. But with the '95 redo, they returned, once again in '98 with the refresh. But when MB dropped the stunning '00 in '99, that stole the show for everyone. '01 brought some good comp for MB, especially since by that time, the W220's quality probs were evident. But the '01 didn't have the fire that the '95 and '98 had, interesting enough. And the '07  SClass has actually sold more of a percentage than the '01 LexusLS, and is still climbing strong, with June being the strongest month behind Feb.But the '07 is sure to have a superior effect on the S. The redesign has been long awaited. And the lsfaithful will not be dissappointed, according to Lexus. The build quality is said to best the outgoing model 10 times over..."
"""The ES330 is no cheaper than a C-class. In fact, the majority of C-class sales come from the cheaper C240 and then you factor in the cheaper C230K and C230 hatch and the average price of a ES330 is much more than the average price of a C-class sold. Same with the  RX . The  RX  MSRPs right up there with the ML350 and the ML350 after discounts probably sells for alot less, yet the  RX  crushes the entire ML lineup in sales.""Wow Max you're ignoring  EClass  costs more than the GS, the SClass costs more than the LexusLS, the SClass costs more than the SCand so on.   Do you realize how illogical it is to ignore the rest of this brand's lineup to make that most illogical point?    Every single Mercedes, except the C and ML cost more, and in some cases way more than each competing Lexus.  The only places where these two brands line up exactly is at the C vs. ES/IS, ML/RX and CLK/SC, in every other case the Benzes cost more.  You don't see this and what affect that may have on sales?   Recently you're post were...well you know...but I can't believe you think there is an even playing ground in prices here when you look at the both brand's entire linuep.  Mercedes is selling cars (and some of them are ""volume"" models) are prices where there is no Lexus to speak of.  I'll give you that the RX crushes the ML.  I've always hated the thing (ML) and it has never lived up to the MB standard.  Syswei's theory about sales indicating which product meets buyer's demands better is correct here because the price difference is negligible. footie, Did you actually read my post before posting?   Your assumptions about sales are ridiculous....like everyone who bought an lslooked at the SClass first and decided on the LexusLS.   Like I said before plenty of unattractive cars sell.  Yes everyone says the lsis a great car, but you seem to miss it when this same group of people, whether it be press or even some buyers, talk about the car's styling, which was my point...not the greatness of the car. ljflx, I don't doubt any of Lexus' plans but no where in your cheering do you account for the fact that nearly every luxury car maker has a huge product offensive planned for the next 2-3 years.  Mercedes and Lexus (how ironic) are probably the brands with the biggest product offensives planned.  Every luxury brand's dealership body has had to expand, from Mercedes to BMW to Audi to Jaguar.  Audi for example has rebuilt every dealership here (except 1) over the last 2-3 years.  They're all bigger and brighter and pretty good looking too. Motorwerks in Barrington IL has done the same thing - a satellite dealership in Hoffman Estates because of increase in sales and the upcoming product offensive.  Lexus is far from being the only luxury brand with lots of things (product) planned. Have you ever read about what Audi is saying about their future in the U.S.?  They saying they'll being doing 200K cars a year by 2008.  I personally don't see that, but this what they're saying.  They have at least 4-5 new models coming during that time frame.   I think the brands to watch as far as new product is concerned are Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, Infiniti and Cadillac.  BMW will probably taper off after the facelifted 7Series and new 3Series for 2006, even still remember the 3Series is a 100K+ unit car in this country alone. I understand what you're saying about Lexus prices, and it is luxury car pricing for sure, but no matter how you spin the prices for Lexus' vehicles they still don't come anywhere near certain Mercedes models.   The action at Lexus is mainly between 33-55K, Mercedes has more models past that price point that are at least trying to be ""volume"" sellers.  Lexus' most expensive car fully dressed costs the same as the baseSClass.   Anyone who thinks this has no bearing on sales is dreaming. "" Now you have a whole bunch of niche MB's that I haven't counted because I have no idea ofthose sales figs. But they are niche and can't be all that great.""Sort of my point.  They have a lot of these so-called niche models that cost more $$ yet some think they're supposed to outsell a company that has nearly all mainstream 33-55K models. Always the most logical Lexus supporter...like in post #5009.  pablo_l, I wouldn't waste any more time responding like you did in post #4968, they're lost to put it mildly.  They theory changes with each and every post, once the previous theory has been shown to be flawed (to say the least).   Sales, models etc. one incorrect statement after another all in the name of hype. syswei, I was about to say you're ignoring price, but then I see you listed the E as outselling the GS.  So you're saying  EClass  meets the needs of the American buyer better than the GS?  designman, When I logged in tonight I saw 57 new posts on this board. I was like WTH!

"""The Explorer/Trailblazer/Durango market is going to shrivel and die soon , and only GM seems to be aware of it.""Finally, GM has stopped lining there pockets with unnecessary amounts of profit and put the money back into the company. The pending Buick Enclave and other GM crossovers are unbelieveably, well, GM. First off, the Enclave will actually one-up the RX, as the laughable Rendezvous was only capable of selling to strickly blue hairs w/o RX budget. The GMC and Saturn versions are just as good. And Gm has vowed to install it's 3.6L high-feature 280hp V6 standard, no need for V8. Pontiac is going all RWD, even the G6 replacement will be so equipped. No need for a Sunfire-type car with Solstice selling as fast as they can make them(at last check, it was outselling Mini, Tiburon, TC, and MX-5 2-1 each, respectively). And Cadillac. Finally America's luxury car will come full-circle. The long-awaited DTS replacement will be RWD and will finally compete with the foreign makes legitmately. And the new CTS with a new 3.6L with VVT on intake/exhaust and 300hp(and the 400hp CTS-v and 505hp CTS-SuperV(with the Vette Z06's LS7) is sure to relight it's extinguishing flame with the onslaught of new comp such as 3Series , '07 G35, '07 A4, and reworked TL.Ford on the other hand, well: The Crossovers that they are hoping to compete with the GM triplets are not going to cut the cake. Even with the new Duratec pushing 250-hp, judging from the previews that have been shown, nothing impressive, especially with the Lincoln and Ford versions being styled by the same one-eyed, hump-backed pencil scripter who designed the shroon Rendezvous. The Mazda version however, very interesting, especially being equipped with the MAZDASPEED 6 turbo 4. Killing the super-old but super-dependable Crown/Marq/TC with no replacement is an automatic death sentence with the few faithful that are left. They'll definetely be shopping Caddy and Lexus harder now as the upcoming MKZ is not going to cut it, even being on the superb Volvo S80 chassis.Chrysler, you're right, the sizzle is fading with LX's. Thankfully Chrysler has sensed this and will roll out the LY cars in '09 M/Y, featuring MB's great Airmatic suspension and for the first time(not counting the 3.2L in the Crossfire), MB engines. The top 300 is said to get the 5.5L in the E550, with the 4.5L as an option. Until then, the 300 and Magnum are due for facelift late '07 early '08, altho the cars are still selling vey briskly. Then Chrysler has joined the flex-fuel crowd on it's 4.7L V8 engines. The HEMI's MDS system must really work as the orders for 5.7L trucks, SUV's and cars surged 67% YTD, especially the Ram pickup and Jeep vehicles. GOOD NEWS: The Crossfire is said to be replaced with the awesome FIREPOWER! concept of a couple years ago. Hopefully so.You see the domestics are on a roll, well sort of with the exception of Ford............"
"""That data...from the same source you just touted...shows that the lshas lower injury rates than the S. In fact it shows that the lsis the safest luxury sedan, period (though if you include station wagons it gets beat by Audi).The part of the survey I showed deals with deaths not injuries.  More injuries in this case didn't translate into deaths. For any Mercedes to be ranked highly anywhere on this survey blows your theory about Mercedes' reliability having an adverse affect on their safety out of the window.  According to you MB's reliablity problems cancel out any advantage they may have in safety engineering because the engineering isn't reliable and doesn't work.  That is simply bogus and isn't supported by anything.  This proves that.  Remember in one hand is CR who ranked  EClass  as the most unreliable this and that in America yet still manages to be safe according to IIHS.   Safer than most other cars on the road.   Also I do see where the CLK is safer than the LexusES, the C-Class 4-door is safer than the IS, and the E is safer than the GS.   Do you not see this? ""So, which is safer in the real world, again?""Mercedes is, beating Lexus in the majority of models in the survey!BTW, I never had anything against their data, never disputed it.  M"
"""The lone M signature appeared on my screen first and I managed a double take. Servants? come hither! Slaughter my best pig, prepare my table, pour my finest wine? my son has returned!""  ? That is too much!  Thanks! Good to be back. So nice to be missed.  ? The M5 and E55: I meant that the M5 will beat the E55/CLS55 in the comparos and anything else upcoming like the Cadillac STS-V.  It is now up to the next Audi RS6 to defeat the new M5.  I agree totally about the M5 and the street, as I've always said that BMW builds better track cars (M) and Mercedes builds better road (AMG) cars.  All the early reviews still say the M5's SMG transmission is no match for a conventional automatic in day to day (automatic mode) driving.  Maybe the next generation SMG trans will finally be as smooth, but I doubt it.  Saleswise AMG and M cars both sell well and will continue to do so.  Mercedes was aware of the hoopla the M5 would get, hence the slightly different tuned CLS55 AMG.  In a Auto, Motor und Sport TV comparo the CLS55 was the equal to the M5 in speed and actually won the comparo becuase the M5 is so uncompromsing on the street, as you noted.   ? As for the 2007 SClass it had better wow the critics like the SLK has done.  Have you seen the praise for this car?  Its even built like a Mercedes should be to boot.  It even made the oh so important Car and Driver 10 Best list.   ? ""Can we look forward to those Monday morning breakfasts with Merc again?""  ? But of course.   ? scottphillip,   ? Yes the CL SClass has just arrived at dealers with a price of $65,620.  It is a stunning car, a complete about face from when I first saw the concept car in 2003.   ? syswei,   ? Thanks again, good to be back on the boards. I have a lot to catch up on here, but I suspect I haven't missed much considering the last few pages about the A8 and LexusLS.  Anyway, I like the M35/45 a good deal, better than the RL or GS. With that said it does kinda have that familar Nissan (Japanese) look about it, kinda like a big Altima or something, and that center console is a little in-your-face-but-plain so its noEClass or A6 as far as styling goes in my book. It does however look better than the new GS.  The Acura RL actually a handsome car from the side and back, but the front is pure Accord.  None of the three Japanese midsizers are a complete piece when it comes to styling, imo...but the M does come closest.   ? I've been told over and over that the M-Class won't offer a third row because the upcoming R-Class and G-Glass replacement will both have a third row.   ? That the Lexus GS450h is a 2007 model year car is all I heard.   ? princeabubu,   ? Thanks.  I'm just not impressed by the ML though I agree it is an all around better truck than before.    ? M"
"""The point is aluminum skin vs. steel skin, not the vehicles themselves.""And this mean what exactly?  You stated that the A8 was less ""safe"" than the LexusLS, of which I see no proof.

"I've driven the car twice. What I like so much about it is that it combines more sportiness than a 750 with more luxury than an A8, especially on the Executive GT version, which has adjustable heated, cooled, and massage seats in front and back, fold-down picnic trays and privacy curtains in the back VDP style, and an Alcantara headliner. Perhaps its biggest strength is its exclusivity. The 760, SClass and A8 W-12 are all very exclusive cars, but they look just like the much more common V8 powered versions. The Q is unique and uniquely Italian, with no hints of German or Japanese influence. The only problem with that is the electronics in the car can't come close to matching the abilities of a Lexus or Mercedes. If you can get past the mediocre NAV system though, its an otherwise phenominal car.http://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_3.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_7.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_8.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5812/1009393_37.jpg"
"""The same can be said of Chevy, Ford and Dodge, with their Corvette, 550hp GT and Viper.""This couldn't be more wrong.  Chevy, Ford and Dodge don't make nearly as many variants of their cars from no hp to 500hp.  Secondly where can I get a Corvette, Viper or GT with no hp in a ""pedestrian"" version.   These cars are specialty models for their repsective makers and don't share squat with Cobalts, Neons and Mustangs that they sell beside.  AnEClass is just that wheter it is a E240 or a E55 AMG. Pure nonesense to even suggest the relationship is the same. ""Your assessment is probably incorrect. Lexus sells around 3300 LexusLS and LX470 alone each month; add almost all of the 2800 or so GX470 which are usually priced over $50k when popular options are added; the a small per centage of fully loaded  RX 's, which has a huge base number to work with, like 9-10k units, even if only 10% of them are fully loaded, that's another 1k units. Add another 700-1k units for SC430. We have what, 7-8k Lexus units sold in the US being over $50k, estimated very conservatively, before even counting any GS model at all. MB only sells 12-13k cars in the US a month. There is simply no way more than half of them are over $50k. MB has a lot of models, but precious little unit sales among its high end models. That also explains why MB quality has gone down the toilet: what little engineering budget there is has to be spread thin.Again, prove me otherwise.  On a yearly basis who sells more cars over 50K was the poster's question.  I said Lexus, now if you think otherwise find Lexus' year end press release and add up all the cars they sell for over 50K.  The  RX  isn't a 50K unless you just want to give Lexus some extra money, meaning it has to struggle to get there in MSRP, if possible and it certainly doesn't sell on average for that price. ""MB only sells 12-13k cars in the US a month.""You are kidding me right?  13K cars a month would be 156K units a year, not the 221K that they sold last year of the 218 in 2003 or the 210K in 2002.  Wrong and grossly incorrect sales theories, look up the numbers.  In Jan 2005 they sold the amount you're talking about due coming down off Dec 2004 in which they sold over 26K units for the month. Present the sales numbers for the SL, CL, S, G, V8EClass/CLK models and compare them to the Lexus LexusLS, GS430, LX470, SC430 and tell me who sells more at 50K or above.  You won't be able to spin the results in Lexus' favor.  The  RX  isn't a 50K vehicle. M"
"""Today, the various cars in the class, 745, LexusLS,SClass, A8, STS are all on a converging path.""In many ways they are, but they're not the same either and a BMW still has the edge in roadholding and agility.  My point about the 7Series  Sport back when was that it was on offer when Lexus no sporty derivatives of the LexusLS back then.   Either way you want to word or compare it the BMW has the edge in handling and road feel for those who want it, numbers don't always tell everything about a car's dynamics.   In the end the 754i Sport will outhandle the LexusLS Euro or whatever it is called.  I don't consider the STS to be in this class.  It is playing the sport role more than any one of these cars and it doesn't have the room of an a8 or  SClass either. M"
"""Unbalanced Whale?"" This is utter nonsense. They even admitted the car wasn't equipped with the 18"" tires and Euro Sport Suspension and admitted it was not a fair test. You're taking everything out of context.Don't try to twist the facts. C&D never said that the test was unfair. Why would C&D put together an article and then discredit themselves by saying it was an unfair test? Give me a break. The only thing C&D said was that the lswasn&#146;t equipped with sport suspension? and they only mentioned it in order to cover their [non-permissible content removed] and qualify the fact that they mistakenly awarded first place to the car with lateral grip worse than most trucks. Even though the lswas not tested with the Euro Sport suspension, it shouldn&#146;t matter by your logic anyway. After all, it wasn't fair for me to compare the more powerful  SClass to the LexusLS so why should it be fair for anyone else to compare the optioned out LexusLS with Euro-Sport vs. a baseSClass? Talk about a double standard. Even if the LexusLS was equipped with these options, it still wouldn't be a BMW... or even an S for that matter, especially given the Lexus interpretation of ""sport"" that translates to ""slightly more consistency than Jell-O with a hair less body roll than a boat"". On another note, it is both humorous and telling that Lexus advertises its cars with so much European flair in an effort to disguise its roots. The stodgy narrator on their commercials has an uppity European accent and now they try to market ""Euro sport"" suspension... why not ""Japanese Sport"" suspension? Sounds like Lexus is trying to be something it isn't.Most every comparo I read says the car was competent but not very exciting. We've already had someone post the braking distance and the lswon by a foot. (hardly a win). And what exactly are the significance of skipad numbers? I take it we all race our cars somewhere on a track..Get real. Even the 0-60 numbers are pointless. Most of us just drive around town or to work with these cars. What's your point about a SClass/600/55? It's not even a fair comparo to begin with. I would hope a 5.0L V8 or V-12 would run faster. You can only compare the SClass to the lsand not the SClass. You're glossing over the details. Not only is the ls""not very exciting"" in every comparo imaginable, but it's also the worst overall performer? every time. Wake me up when Lexus engineers a car that doesn't perform and handle like a bus. I don't have my Consumer Report library in front of me at the moment, but it would be interesting to see how the lsscored against the SClass in other performance aspects.For 13K less, the LexusLS has more standard features than theSClass. I shopped for both and I know what I'm talking about. They wanted 73K for a SClass 4 Matic with Nav and a few other things. My 62K LexusLS has way more features than theSClass, and there is not a huge difference in performance. The lsis more spirited and comfortable, whilst the S is a bit harsher in ride but better at high speeds.For 13K less, you may get a better ratio of standard features, but once you add options to an SClass you get more features overall.  Besides, Lexus makes you pay for things like navigation and pre-safe, both of which Mercedes includes as standard.  Anyway, something about your statement makes me skeptical. You say that you were looking at an ""S430 for $73k"" with ""4-Matic, Nav and a few other things."" Well that's very interesting considering that Navigation has been standard since the 2000 model year (optional with Lexus) and 4-matic is currently a no cost option (not available with Lexus). The frame construction is probably the biggest factor in the equation here. Electronics as you've mentioned aren't going to make a huge difference. I've mentioned the Airbus vs Boeing Argument. And you've failed to realize no sane CEO of any airline would fly a plane that was not as safe as a competitor. No competent industry insider would dare imply an Airbus is unsafe since it has fewer safety features than a 747.What are you talking about? If, as you say, an Airbus has fewer safety features than a 747, it is by default less safe... Hands down. More safety features = greater safety. CEOs pull this kind of crap all the time right under people's noses. The same is true in the auto-industry. The CEO of Lexus figures he can get away with skimping on safety features and waiting many years before adopting innovations pioneered by others because he knows that most people are ignorant sheep who can't tell the difference. Those loyal to the Lexus cult are eager to drink their special punch because they figure that Lexus can do no wrong, without even checking things out for themselves. For example, I think it was michael_mattox that didn't know that his lsdidn't have rear side airbags... he just assumed it did. Assuming that a company &#147;wouldn&#146;t risk building an unsafe car&#148; is completely absurd. Companies do it all the time? just look several GM and older Fords. It's like putting PreSafe in a Kia..You think all those electronics are going help if the Frame isn't built well? I'm sure MB has a great frame construction, but so does Lexus. I've taken a real world crash in my LexusLS and it barely moved despite being hit at 35MPH from the side. Granted there was 7K worth of damage to it, but it kept everyone in the car safeYes, frame strength is one aspect that contributes to overall safety. But I&#146;m not sure why you assume that Lexus has equally good frame construction. Personal anecdotes are nice but aren&#146;t exactly the best indicator of vehicle safety. I&#146;m sure that more than one person has wrapped their Cavalier around a tree and lived to tell about it, but I think that both of us can agree that the Cavalier is probably one of the least safe cars on the road. Just because you got lucky one time doesn&#146;t mean anything. Now, I&#146;m not saying that the lsis unsafe per say, but I am saying that you can buy safer."
"""Well then that progress to produce a sporty design took a long time - 100 years or so.""Right, like other cars during those years, 4-door luxury cars to be exact had such swoopy designs.

"""Yikes! If that is the case the class will be once again sent back to the drawing board. It sounds nice, but a base A8 with 470hp sounds like a little bit much to me.""You thinks thats crazy, try a 550-hp W-12 for '09 and a 630-hp S8 for '10/'11. Audi is getting very serious at taking MB/AMG head on in terms of powerplants. They are even developing new Quattro systems and pneumatic suspensions to handle all the twist that these engines will produce.Audi is on a war-path here in the States. I guess they finally got V-Dub to loosen up a bit and give them more directional stability here. They're developing new and improved ways of producing the legendary aluminum bodies so it'll be less costly on both the company and the customer(insurance). But there is one constraint that I have to pick at: PRICE! I wonder where will this send their pricing strategy. If they're going after MB, then for sure they don't think that they can command MB's primo prices? Not yet at least.BTW, BMW is awfully quiet with the 7Series. I haven't heard anything on the new replacement, but hear that the new car will too send the carmakers back to the planning board. BTW, remember when the A8 came out in '04. It's 335-hp engine was more powerful than the SClass(302hp), the 7Series l(325hp),the ls(at the time-290hp), and XJ(294hp). So this Audi's plan of attack again to out-power all of the other car's for at least a year or two."
"""You do have a point there. tiag_M5 has repeatedly said the LexusLS is UNSAFE because of the exclusion of a single airbag. No question all high end marques will fare better, but this goes to show the difference that an airbag will make using a common benchmark. You will agree all cars in the compact class have similar build quality?""Well you and Tiag_M5 will have to debate the first part of that, I didn't claim that.  My only point was that it seems that anything Lexus isn't leading in is deemed unimportant or irrelevant. A luxury car should have all the latest safety features along with all that other stuff you prize, is my point.  Most cars in this segment probably do have a similar build in their structure, but there is no way for any of us here to know that.  Just in my limited experience and looking at the specs I think the 5000lb VW Phaeton would be safer than any car here, but that is just my personal belief.  It seems to be a veritable tank to me. "" If so, then you will agree the marginal effects of such side airbags will also be accurately shown. The VW Beetle is a superbly engineered car, but the side impact airbags didn't make a difference. In the Corolla case, it made only a marginal difference. The key here is the structure is the No 1 line of defense in a crash. It goes to show that a single airbag does not make one car safer than the other.""I don't really think this is a good example because the VW is a two door car and the Toyota is a regular 4 door, seems to me the Beetle is more at risk in a side impact compared a sedan. Styling - you are correct way too personal to really debate, but we do.

"Infiniti is a successful flagship away from being on the same level as Lexus.Now, Infiniti will never match Lexus in sales, because they will not sell a lux version of the Altima (a la ES/Camry) or a lux version of the Murano (a la RX/Highlander).  But in the segment that it's in (other than the flagship segment of course), it matches up pretty well against Lexus.The G competes well against the IS, and the M competes well against the GS.

Different people will have different opinions of what ""the standard"" of the large luxury sedan should be, and depending on one's needs/desires an S,A8,7, or LexusLS, or something else, might qualify as being ""the standard"".  Some people might think the standard should be more luxurious and gravitate toward an LexusLS, others might think it should be more sporty and gravitate toward the 7.The fact that the lsis the unit sales leader in the segment suggest that the lsis ""the standard"" in more peoples' eyes than is the S.3.

I suggest you pay attention as IS, particulary IS350, reviews come out...and suggest a test drive if a 3 or C are in your future.BTW, if passion and soul are so important, I don't see why the non-M BMWs fail to beat the non-AMG MBs in your eyes."
"2008 Crown Majesta: This car was styled in the mold of the MB CLS. And I tell you, its a darn close match to the CLS, but looks quite nice, once you get past the copy thingy. The rear is not as droopy as the CLS, nor does it make rear passengers claustophobic. A nicer-looking variant of the CLS, IMO. Very nicely done by Toyota... Even spots the motor in the LexusLS, and is similar to the LS460 in size. But priced real well at Y6Million - Y8Million, almost half the price of the 600hL. A steal, if you ask me. I'd even consider buying this car over the LS460 at this price.  2008 Crown Royal: Has the V6 3.5L 315HP DOHC motor, and is priced at Y3.5Million - Y6Million. This is the baby-LS looking car from front, but does not have the integrated exhaust into bumper rear, as in the lsand Majesta. Not a bad looking car, but don't expect to see one in the US, like forever... so my Japanese friends tell me. Sorry, Garyh.Thanks, oac, for all this info.  From what I had read previously, I thought the Crown Majesta and the Crown Royal were just different setups of the same car body (like GS300/GS430).  From what you are saying, apparently they are actually totally different cars?All I want for my wife's next car (replacing her aging E320, a very nice car) is something slightly smaller than the LexusLS (but better space utilization than the GS), RWD or preferably AWD (unlike the ES), with lots of wood and luxury.  Why won't Toy/Lex bring at least one of these Crowns here, and take the MB E head on and win.  Couldn't they easily sell more than a couple thousand a month, which is all they are getting out of the GS?  I don't get it.At this point, I'm still thinking of another E for her.  Or maybe we'll move to Japan so I can get her a Crown.  :confuse:"
"According to my Analysis, BMW makes ""quantum leaps"" in pricing when they introduce next generation of vehicles. And during model years they go for incremental increases. Your analysis?  Oh sure.Historically, a ""next generation"" vehicle is introduced after the current life cycle or model cycle is complete.  Sometimes there is a mid cycle change or facelift or slight modifications, updates, and incremental improvements and refinements.  As a new generation vehicle is released, the opportunity arises for the new price to increase, decrease or stay the same.  This can be a very deliberate and strategic decision in some circumstances.  In any event, there are historical circumstances when the life cycle of a model and all of its incremental price increases resulted in a final price that is just too darned high for the replacement.  In these cases the next generation car therefore becomes the perfect time to introduce the ""new and improved"" model at a ""new lower price"".  By ""resetting"", that is reducing, the price at this opportunity, the price can then incrementally increase once again year after year.  Without this occasional ""reset"", prices would never come back in line as they should, and they could ultimately escalate wildly without limitations.  I am not suggesting that Lexus should reduce their prices, but I am suggesting that you recognize that price reductions and/or constraints generally INCREASE market share.  Theoretically, the GLOBAL (as you put it) automobile market is in a position to afford MORE cars at MODERATE prices than at HIGH prices.  From a business standpoint, it makes sense to INCREASE sales.  So, as the global demographics indicate, the volume of automobile sales will generally and proportionally INCREASE with a DECREASE in price structure. This is just a general and basic rule of global economics.Therefore, to take your argument about quantum price change a little further, it is logical to extrapolate that the best incentive for increased sales is to offer a quantum price REDUCTION!  This will then increase the sales volume even further.That being said, it could be argued that it makes MORE sense to campaign for a quantum price REDUCTION of the LexusLS.  Just think how many more they would sell!!!   :P TagMan"
"Actually get a reality check, the A4 is not a unique Audi platform. It's been a Passat platform underneath for years.  You can bet platform sharing is growing too. You can eventually bet on a Audi A6 being spun out of a stretched Passat platform also.Actually, the new Passat is I believe Jetta based. I'm not sure about the '02-present A4, but the next car is based on a universal Audi architecture called MLP that is supposed to go into the next A6 and A8 as well. Its the one that will finally give the A4 (and I assume the rest of the sedans) a proper front-mid engine layout. VWs wont get it. The A5, Q5, and A7 are also supposed to be on this platform. Chrysler and Mercedes on the other hand are moving closer together. Until now Chrysler's using Mercedes parts have been last generation, obsolete Mercedes (SLK320\Crossfire, E430\300C). Chrysler is using Mercedes' 5-speeds, but I dont think they have access to the 7-speed. That may change when they start sharing ""phoenix"" engines."
"""The FX is a great, edgy design, but it is not very space-efficient. Not good for families. Everytime I see one, a single male is driving it. I would deem it successful, but it is niche vehicle, unable to play in the  RX 's sandbox. It will need to get bigger inside, and gain a less BMW interior, to have mass appeal.""Agree with your points.  But the point of the FX is that you don't want it to have mass appeal.  You don't want it to play in the RX's sandbox.  That's why I say that Infiniti is a flagship away from Lexus status.  They do fine in the segments that they are in, except the flagship class.  Infiniti doesn't need to compete with the ""volume"" LexusES and RX to be seen in the same status.  These 2 vehicles make up almost 60% of Lexus sales.  And we all know that high sales don't necessarily equal prestige.My feeling is that Infiniti needs to do something real special for the next Q.  No one can out-lux a Lex, so benchmarking the lsis out.And I wouldn't target the 7Series either.  What I'd do if I were Infiniti would be to target and market a ""poor man's"" Aston Martin sedan.  Svelte, revolutionary styling is key."
"All this spin and denial about Lexus copies from the market leaders is just more of the same in the way of excuses for people who can't accept the fact that Lexus learns from, but can't help copy from also, from those same leaders. All this BS about ""core competence"", ""Lexus ran out of staff"" (!) and lumping sales of completely different vehicles are definitiely signs of sore losers who can't accpet the fact that Lexus hasn't hit a home run everytime out the gate. Nothing more than grand excuse making at its very, ill-concieved best. The part about Lexus running out of staff is the most ridiculous thing I have read on here since reading how theSClass/760Li aren't luxury cars. BS, copycat, ultimate follower, spin, hype, sore losers, blah blah.... Geez.. Is this your idea of a debate ? Just when we expect you to come back with some real good story about the show, all you do is drag the quality of this forum down with rhetorics. Its 2006, and we all gotta turn a new leaf... Tone down rhetorics and put downs. Doesn't advance the debate. Have I said this before or what ???Oh, wrt the new LS460, so far I have stayed on the sidelines reading everything before commenting. I wanted to read many opinions and see lots of pictures. Appears that overall, MORE people like it than not. That is good. Me, I got my check in hand now. My search for a replacement for my '99 lsis over already. The newly styled LS460 SWB with its 380bhp, mid-20 mpg, 8-speed tranny, auto park, smart card, 7.1 DTS 19-speaker ML, 8GB of HD space for 4000 songs, etc.. etc...   has me won over. Another car that should give the Germans fits... And the class redefined all over again. Especially, if the $3K lift of base price over 2006 LexusLS rumor turns out to be true. Can the 335hp S450 touch the LS460 ? I don't think so. Can the 382  SClass touch the LS460 ? Yup. But it will be a battle indeed. The lswill continue to outsell the SClass again, only this time, the sales gap will grow even larger. My prediction... What's yours ?"
"And again what does anyone care about this? We know this, we've been known this for years and years when it comes to Toyota and their production costs, skills etc., but what difference does it make to anyone who doesn't live for pointing it out day in and day out? ... This is nothing but the old buyers-care-about-profits type stuff which is irrelevant.Let me try this one more time.  Here is the line from Len that started you off on this tirade:But if you have a lower cost to build you use that to your advantage on pricing and they continue to have a huge edge on the Germans in build cost.Len said absolutely nothing about people buying cars because of fascination with Toyota's profits.  We are talking (really speculating at this point) about how the new LSes will be priced as against the Ses and the 7s (and the A8s for that matter).  The point is that if Company A can build a car for $50,000 that can compete in the marketplace against another car from Company B that costs B $60,000 to make, Company A can potentially charge anywhere up to $10,000 less than Company B and still stay in business.  If A can sell as much as it wants at the same price as B sets for its product, it will.  But if it can't meet its sales goals at that price, A can come down and sell the car for anywhere between $50,000 to $60,000 that it needs to to get the job done.The relevancy right now?  Len has been suggesting that Toyota has been moving up the price of the lstowards the S and the 7 for the last few years, and will be doing it again even more forcefully with the new versions of the lsit will be introducing.  So if his surmise is correct, THE CUSTOMERS WHO ACTUALLY BUY THESE CARS WILL BE EXPERIENCING A SHRINKING OF THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE BRANDS.  Understandably, if someone is only interested in the history, or the technology of these cars, PRICING IS IRRELEVANT.  But for those people who are actually looking at buying one of these cars, PRICING STRATEGIES ARE EXTREMELY RELEVANT.Now, you just have to accept that some people who frequent this forum are actually mostly interested in possibly purchasing one or more of these cars and want to learn about them.  Others may be more interested in the business side of building these cars.  Still others (and I assume you fall in this category) are only interested in appreciating these cars for their individualized approaches to beauty and amazing implementation of technology.  Hopefully you agree that there is room in this forum for all of these folks.Pricing is very relevant to people in the first two categories.  Pricing is totally irrelevant to people who only fall in the third.  [For example, the fact that MB is dropping the price of the  SClass by about $2K likely is not very significant to your interest in the car; for people in the first two categories it may be VERY interesting.]  As long as the context of the discussion is ""High End Luxury Marques"", a mention of pricing strategies available to a manufacturer about to introduce a new HELM car is indeed relevant and appropriate - and to some of us, even (dare I say it?) interesting.I rest Len's case."
"And any car doesn't *drive* according to you ???? Does an MB drive any better than a Lexus, or a Toyota or a Honda ? Like the S-, 7-, the lsis a RWD car, which means a better driving car than any FWD car. That the car *isloates* the driver is a part of luxury Lexus defines.... that which puts the ruts and grunts of the road outside the equation.Lots of questions there.  Let me see, YES IMO a Benz drives better than a Lexus (at least in this segment we're talking about) because the ride is nearly the same in softness yet the S doesn't have the weak steering and keel over like the current LexusLS.  Now please explain to me why you think a car like a lsdrives better than a high-end Toyota like the Avalon because its RWD. I seriously doubt any lsowner on this board has pushed their lshard enough to be able to tell which wheels are doing the driving and/or to be able to explain the benifits of RWD when it comes to handling.  You've got to be kidding me if you have to ask whether or not a 7Series drives better than a regular car OAC.  You should know the answer to that question.  No, feeling every imperfection in the road isn't my definition of driving hence me liking the SClass over the 7Series and A8, but mushy steering and keeling over like the lsisn't my definition either.  M"
"And as we all know(or should know) over 50% of luxury cars are leased, so the case that the lssells better because it's cheaper doesn't hold much water. It most certainly does ""hold water"" if that other 50 percent (per you) still buys instead of leasing.  No on is saying that it being cheaper is the sole  reason for lsselling better, only that it plays a factor in that ""50 percent"" estimate.  A good deal of folks (right here on these boards) still ""buy"" cars vs leasing them. M"
"And how many S8 or S63 sales would be made again ???? I guess you don't understand that everything isn't about sales.  We were talking about a sporty sedan that is what the 7Series Sport, S8 and upcoming S63 will be, sporty sedans in the full-size luxury car class.  They aren't made just for sales, they're made for people who want some with a little more bite, something I guess isn't understood in LexusLS land.  Who cares what they sell, that doesn't change the fact that they are there. Let's face it, MBs and BMWs derive a huge chunk of their Euro sales from low end 3 and C-class cars that are mostly used as sherpas.... taxi cabs, I mean.. These cars litter the streets of Europe - vinyl seats, no A/C, manual windows, steel wheel covers, pretty much bare-bones... All of which counts towards MB and BMWs *prestige*, eh ? Oh, but here in NA, they market them exclusively as luxury brands... Good marketing that's all... So what, they ain't lost one lugnut of prestige by doing this for over 100 years.  It must be frustrating to keep repeating something as irrelevant as that, because buyers in those countries don't care.   If you're going to ""face it"" then you'd be facing the fact that no matter what BMW and Mercedes sells at the low end their top end M, AMG, V12, 2-door, convertibles etc. etc. get all the glory.  This is something Lexus only wishes it had.   Now if Lexus can overcome their Toyota roots with certain buyers here then surely Mercedes and BMW can overcome some entry-level products that aren't their main focus.  Does it bother LexusLS and SC430 buyers that a ES330 is a Camry in leather?  Heck no.  Ditto goes for a  SClass buyers who sees a B200 Turbo or a 7Series buyer that sees a 130i in the same showroom.     Darn right BMW/Mercedes are masters at marketing, its a cheap shot to knock them for that.  Yes, MB and BMW are pretigious brands, no doubt, but to make them into these super brands is a myth, especially these days. Notice how the new GS is priced close to the comparable MBs and BMWs. How about the new IS and its MB and BMW competition... practically about same. Does that tell you something ??? Yeah it does.  It says that Lexus see itself getting closer to BMW and Mercedes in those market segments, sure does.  The brand itself, years off from doing the same as a whole.   BTW, I don't make BMW and Mercedes out to be superbrands, only that they are more prestigious than Lexus.  The ""Super Brands"" would be Bentley, Rolls, Ferrari, Aston-Martin and the like. The kinda of sentiment MB had back in 1989. Continue the sarcasm... No, that is isn't sarcasm.  Lexus being a no-go in their homd market is called a fact.   It isn't the Germans fault that Lexus didn't start their dominance in their own market and let foreigners have their own homeland luxury car market. Also I noticed on the 2007 lsboard you stated that because the lsthread has more traffic than the 2007 SClass thread that means trouble for theSClass.  I guess that must be the same trouble the better sellingEClass is in next to the much more popular 2006 GS thread.  Too funny. M"
"And moreover, the lsis a cheaper produced car, and this makes it better than any car in it's class? Yes cheaper at the expense of a flaccid suspension, wood so shiny you could see the food between your teeth, the most supportive seats in the class, the dreaded gated shifter(only a smidge better than the J-Gate), oh, and styling? Dare I say, underwhelming to say the very least. These are things that don't make for a very appealing car to a broad spectrum.More Lexus bashing.... So I take it that the higher priced A8/7/ SClass are better than the lower priced ls? And to a broad spectrum of buyers ? OK... Got it...Hopefully these things that Lexus has corrected, but in Toyota fashion, highly unlikely.. I could bash Audi all I like, but for what purpose ? The car is what it is.. a low seller here in the NA market. Conversely, despite ALL these dishing of the LexusLS, the car remains a TOP seller here. Bash all you like... The new lsrolls in soon... and then the fun begins"
"And pound for pound, I don't rate the current LexusLS any higher than a DTS, despite the FWD, it too is just a cruiser, something that it's fine doing and not posing as anything else. You sure sound like a GM salesperson.And pound for pound, I don't rate the current DTS any higher than a ES350. Oh, wait, DTS is no where close to the ES350 in terms of luxury, performance, and sales."
"Are you suggesting that when the minivan market diminished that the manufacturers should stop making a great minivan? Ridiculous to suggest that just because the SUV market is slowing that the market is dead somehow.Two things mixed in here. The minivan market is by far NOT diminished or dead... It is doing quite well, but not for the R. The SUV market OTOH is another story. It is not dead but slowing, as you correctly noted.The ugly R has NOTHING to do with the GL. Any suggestion that it does is idiocy. Whoever suggested as such, Tagman ? And why the bitterness ? Glad to see you agree the R is ugly... your words...Listen to me clearly here. The SUV will NEVER die! There will ALWAYS be an adequate market for SUV'sYes, sir. I am all ears... The GL is poised to resurrect the SUV market. Thanks to MB's superstar truck. The answer to what many of us SUV lovers have been waiting for...The GL is poised to do very well. It will be the one to beat. There will always be sales of Suburbans, although less than before, and the GL will be the ULTRA alternative. The new GL will be the truck to beat, and will be the alternative to the Burb ? {Trying to clean my contacts just to be sure I am reading u right} .... Someone needs to check the pipe u are smoking, lol. MB wants to compete against GM in SUVs ??? In 2006 ??? Good luck to them in this race for #1 ""ULTRA alternative"" to 'Burb. BTW, would the GL go up against the likes of the LX470, GX470, Escallade, Navigator, etc... ?Sheesh ! Meanwhile, I am looking forward to news about the 2007 LS460 and other juicy stuff from Detroit. I am staying tuned to the NAIAS, and hoping we learn more about the S and the LexusLS, as they battle for supremacy in the HELM market."
"As an alternative to the  SClass and 750Li I can see why, but compared to the 760 and especially SClass this car still won't have the power to compete, especially with the 510hpSClass.Remember how the 4.6L (LS460) engine puts out same HP as the 5.5L in the  SClass ? And the LS460 is already in the low 5s range 0-60. Don't let the 430HP fool you... Its the gobs of torque from the battery and the larger V8 motor that makes this car run like a gazelle... Rumor has it that Lexus has the car pegged to the 4.7 - 4.9s 0-60 (S600 range), and an array of gadgets to really be revolutionary, a la 1989 all over again. What was revealed today were bare-bones.... Since the car is 1 year away, lots remain hidden by Lexus, to be revealed much much later... This car will challenge MB/BMW/Audi, but most especially the SClass despite the HP advantage for the latter... Guess we'll see."
"As far as Lexus cars looking alike, if you look at the cars, in profile, they definitely look much different from each other. The GS has a more rounded profile. The IS is full of particularly sharp styling cues, and is heavily starched, without becoming an Acura TL. The lsfalls in between. So I'm not seeing it either, Merc. A crease here or there, but that's it. Oh I didn't think you would, though in the pics its obvious from the rear.  I agree that the GS doesn't look the same from the side.  Thank goodness the lsand IS don't have the humpback whale look of the GS - its awful looking from the sides. And the ML has obviously learned quite a bit from the original RX300.HA! Small problem, the ML came out BEFORE the original RX300 so this statment is just flat out false regarding styling. M"
"As usual, you castigate every dissenting viewpoint to yours... Hype, wannabe, envy, etc.. Here is a simple factoid for you: can you tell us which MB has had an in-dash CD changer for years and are sold here in the US ??? And as usual your posts are minus the facts.  Yes I can tell you,  EClass . The E has had an in-dash CD changer since 2003.  Audis had them from 2002-2004, until the moved the back to the glovebox for the latest A6 and A8.  A simple check of the fact OAC will do it everytime.   To say that they can't is simply nothing more than hype because they have (E/Audis) and will (upcoming S). Of course. German cars were never defined by cup holders either, but they do now, eh ? Maybe the point escapes you: that the Germans think CD changers deserve to be in the trunk, while a $15K KIA can put one in-dash. I chose Kia, a Korean car as an example here. I could have chosen a Ford ZX3, which is even cheaper at $11K.... And please note that luxury car makers don't brag about having an in-dash CD changer, but it sure sucks if your $60K+ car cannot even provide a basic feature you'd find in far less cars ??? That's the point.... Point is that nearly no one cares as much as people who tend to knock every German car to begin with.  Please note that because German cars don't put CD changers where you think they should be doesn't mean the world or much of anything to everyone else.  When those lower level cars you harp about drive anything like a German car then you'll have a point, until then you don't.  Pure hype and minus the facts at that. M"
"Audi A8/A8L and A8 W12 are all HELM cars. Ditto Lexus' LexusLS, soon to be a whole series of LSs - 460/460L/600h/600hL. MB has the SClass/S600/S63/S65 as HELM cars in this space, and BMW has the trio of 7Series/7SeriesL/760iL. All of these cars fit our HELM definition. Are these cars not high-end ? Yes. Are they not luxurious ? Yes they are. Are they not marque cars ? Yes they are, for each of the car companies.... Absolutely! That is what we are talking about here on this board.  As HELM car makers, MB, Audi and BMW are solid HELM companies by virtue of their HELM stable of cars, however Lexus makes it into the HELM club by virtue of the lsseries.oac - good post, but let's not forget Jaguar, which easily meets your well-explained criteria.Thanks,TagMan"
"The company has to do a better here in North America with this car. The A3/A4/A6 and heck even the Q7 will sell themselves, but when dealing with a customer that's about to plop 70-80 large on a car, you must know what the customer is wanting in a car. The current A8 has it, but there has been a huge communications breakdown here that has inhibited Audi's share of the pot. Hopefully this will change soon.And we can always hope that by the '09 model year, Audi will have given up on that ""wide-mouth bass"" front end, or at least figured out how to make it better fit in with the rest of the car's design.  That kept me personally from even considering the car the last time."
"Based on posts on the SClass board that's not the type of passion to be proud of. Personally I think all this passion nonsense is severely overblown and overhyped. If the passion was real the car would not lose value as rapidly as it does. In the 80's the passion argument made sense. Today it is total nonsense. Really?  The excitement on the 2007 lsboard is surely more indicative of how the car will sell then right?  The new S won't sell anything because the same people aren't posting over and over like on the 2007 lsboard right?Let me see if I have this right, just because Lexus doesn't inspire anything beyond raving about CD changers and driving along in total isolation what others feel for BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Jaguar and others Euros is nonesense.  Yet when Lexus comes out with this V10 sports car and this rumored 400+hp LS600h you'll all of a sudden get passionate about Lexus because they'l truly have something worth getting passionate about right? There is nothing passionate about a car that looks like a Jaguar XK or CLS or the power of an M5 or the sound of a V10 or the design of a car like the A8?  Come you know you like some of these Euro cars when you aren't reading Consumer Reports. M"
"Actually I'm glad that some BMW fans have joined the forum. Welcome! When I see MB fans repeatedly deride Lexus for not being sporty enough for their tastes, I always wonder, why are these guys not BMW fans? Thats because Mercedes has always been in the middle of a BMW and a Lexus in terms of sportiness.  Most Mercedes buyers don't want the full on sportiness of a BMW, but they don't want the Toyota/Buick like drive/feel of the any Lexus outside of the new GS/IS either.  There is always more control in the German car or more importantly the feel of more control than you get in Lexus' core models like the lsand LexusES.   Now the GS and IS are sportier models supposedly chasing after BMW, but they don't hit the mark there either. BTW, I like all three German luxury car makes. M"
"I am looking forward to driving the ls460 this Fall to see if I notice an improvement in the vehicle's handling. I wish they would get rid of that cursed gated shifter too. Dont hold your breath on that one. The lshas had a gated shifter from '95 on, and since the '04  RX , all Lexus automatics have them."
"Both lsand S are sweet, and it doesnt hurt me if lssells for 20K or 80K, its just that despite having a better product, lssells at cut-rate prices, which confounds me.This ""better product"" thing will go nowhere fast.  Mercedes was long in existence before anyone even THOUGHT of Lexus.  Mercedes is legendary with mostly ups and a few downs throughout its life so far, with many bright years ahead.  Lexus came along and was certainly needing to emulate certain criteria to establish itself, and needed to do so at a price point that would foster its success.  Only recently have Lexus folks started to consider that the cars are good enough to be priced at the same price point as the competition.  But . . . do they perform as well as the Mercedes or Bimmers?  No they do not!!!  And only just recently has there been the little IS model showing signs of potential performance.  But the IS is no HELM and there is still no HELM from Lexus that performs as well . . . at least not yet!  There are other considerations . . . styling being one of them.  The newest lsmodels show signs of improved styling, but let's not get carried away.  Other than the LS600hL, they still seem a bit on the neutral and safe side of the design curve . . . attractive enough certainly, but no heart throbbing going on.  Yes, the reliability statistic is still in the Lexus's favor, but that gap is likely to close considerably.  Remember, Mercedes has a long reliable history, and the few bumps in the road in recent years do not change that forever.Lexus, the better product?  There is no justification based upon product reviews of the currentSClass, to determine that the SClass has somehow been trumped.  Again, almost every review puts it at the top.  Currently, the only lsavailable is NOTHING close!  The upcoming lswill be a better warrior and the fight will be more interesting, but the champion to be defeated is theSClass, and nothing has yet changed that.The LS600hL should not be compared to the SClass, and it is a different car of sorts, and it will be a wonderful Lexus, indeed.  There are many months to sort out just where it lies in the mix of cars later this year or early next year.Also, consider that there is NOTHING that Lexus offers to compare to the AMG versions of Mercedes vehicles.  Do you hear that?  NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!Lexus marketers are smart . . . no . . . brilliant.  They KNOW that the price must be one of the advantages, or else . . . or else the ""value"" will fade.  Without that perception of ""value"", things would be very different indeed.  So, put down that famous kool-aid that has been referred to here many times and look at the FACTS.So, who's better?  Give me a break.TagMan"
"Boy, you sure have an issue with the A8 don't you  ? What issue ? I simply provided a link and commented on hard facts. Can't handle facts ?  ? The problem with the lsis that it is an old man's car in looks and in performance  ? And by inference, the A8 and 7Series are for YOUNG people in looks and performance. That's why these cars are in high demand by the baby boomers who don't care to drive an old person's car like the LexusLS! Ooppsss.... The lsoutsells the A8 and the 745/760 COMBINED. It must be that ""car enthusiasts"" are in such short supply otherwise the sales trend should be in the other direction, if your logic holds true.  ? Sarcasm aside, the simple fact is that car manufacturers are in the business to make money. The A8 and 7Series are NOT niche cars, but sell like one. If the trend continues, both BMW and VW/Audi would not be able to sustain the continued loss of market share by their premier sedan, and something will have to give. If the lsis outselling its competition COMBINED, it must be doing something right. Maybe it's time for BMW and Audi to *copy* Lexus' lssuccess formula. Would help their bottomline a great deal."
"But from what I hear from Ingolstadt, the '09 replacement for the current A8 will correct all of the wrong-doings here in the States. It's said to come to market with a 4.2 FSI V-8 with about 470-hp/8-speed tranny as the ""base"" engine and a ""clean"" V-10 TDI within the first year it comes to the States. Yikes!  If that is the case the class will be once again sent back to the drawing board.  It sounds nice, but a base A8 with 470hp sounds like a little bit much to me.  I did read that for 07' all V8 A8 and A6 models get the 350hp version of the 4.2L FSI V8 - a typical German car company move as far as engines go. So it all remains to be seen. I'm not giving up on my favorite German brand!! No please don't because I'm not!     Audi is only second to MB in my eye when it comes to luxury cars, BMW used to be #2 but they just aren't pretty enough across the range for me to feel the same way anymore.  That is however just when looking at them however because they still remain arguably the best drive of the 3. M"
"But here is my biggest blunder yet for the SClass: Why is it that the previousSClass/500 could be equipped  no-cost with 4Matic and the new  SClass tacks on a $3k tariff to have the safety of AWD. M-B says the 4Matic will account for 20% of all  SClass sales. They may have a tougher time moving them, then, again, this is MB were talking about........ Well that was only done for the last couple of model years on the W220 as an incentive to keep them selling.  Prior to that it as an extra-cost option. The new LS460 appears not to have AWD so the  SClass 4Matic will likely be in hot demand for those who really new AWD. I just wish Audi would promote Quattro (A8 in this case) more in certain MB strongholds in the North and Northeast. M"
"But just remember, there is no absolute here, only Stoli and Grey Goose. Since you want me to have the last word, I will take it  :P True... no absolutes... The lsis NOT a value buy compared to an Avalon, but is a value buy compared to an SClass. However, at a $65K price point, one can choose to buy 3 Matrix'es and still have a few thou to salt away for the kids College fund, take in a dinner and a movie...  So who needs an expensive LexusLS, 745, SClass, A8, XJR, anyway ? I have my value car and its cheap to drive, cheap to maintain, and a fun little car to boot. Value ahoy !!!"
"But life is changing fast now. The lsis now the trendsetter with the 600HL and it has set the bar beyond the SClass. Life changes once you are well established. Lexus' infancy and teenage years are history now. Not sure why you'd say this at this point? The car hasn't even been driven by anyone yet. The details of the thing haven't even been finalized and it hasn't even gone on sale yet.  I can't wait to see what Lexus puts the LS600hL against.  I suspect it will be the  SClass because the LS600hL doesn't have a prayer of matching performance with theSClass, but with 430hp and better MPG it will be the perfect competitor to the SClass. As for this whole argument about helms - I find it rather lame. Lexus reaches over $50K with 4 models - the LexusLS, the LX, the SCand the GX. Under the right scenarios you can add in the RX hybrid too. It reaches over $60K with three of those 4 and over $70K with two of those four if they are fully loaded. With the new lshybrid and the GT it will reach over $100K. I don't see how anyone can argue they are a one car Helm or even begin to argue they don't belong. Sure Lexus has some cars in the 50K area, who doesn't?  That doesn't say much, 50K isn't ""high-end"" anymore, even VW has a SUV at that price as does Toyota. Everyone from Acura to Infiniti has a 50K model on sale regardless as to whether or not it actually sells for that price.  Two cars that barely get into (but don't sell for on average) the 70Ks doesn't put Lexus on par with MB and BMW, but it does put Lexus on a higher level than most other supposed to be HELM brands.  Whether or not Lexus is a true HELM depends on where you draw the line.  If the line is 50K then there are more HELMs to be added to the list, but here since most seem to focus on just HELM sedans, Lexus barely makes the cut which is where that one car comment comes in.

"Welcome back, stranger. I've said from day one that the Sonata is recalling of the '98-'04 A6, particularly the rear quarter area. It's overall shadow is reminding of that car, which was a very elegant and intriguing car to mimic. EClass  quite naturally will pull the grunt for MB, but shockingly to see it's sales this good as the freshened E350/new E550 on the horizon. The R-Class will remain a thorn in the side of DCX NA until they either abandon it State side or lower the price of admission to give it at least a chance, much in the same way Chrysler did the Pacifica. Speaking of, why not invest all of the R-Class' incredible architecture and design into Chrysler. It just seems more plausible to give this type of car to a more American company. Do you think that the 300 will be at home on a Mercedes lot with it's bold design? Probably not.And to hoot, a fully laden R500 will empty the bank to the tune of $70k, which is a lot of dough for a crossover. And with the GL and M hanging over it's head, it doesn't stand a chance here. Interestingly enough, the GL outsold the M for the month and is still pulling strong.As for Toyota/Lexus, Lexus' new/future car product is nothing short of applausible, but we're still in America, the home of the truck. Toyota will at some point have to revamp the luvable but quite old and expensive LX 470/Land Cruiser's as the competition is steadily improving, but those two are still with the status-quo. But they do remain some of the most comfortable to drive ladder-frame SUV's(save for RR and Escalade) around."
"But more broadly on the theme of my original post, I don't know about your circle of friends or family, but only a small minority of people I know aspire/own an MB. Two friends own an MB - E320 and an  SClass - that's it. The majority are BMW, Lexus and Infiniti buyers. I am 42, and my circle don't consider MB as a car to have.What car do they consider the ""one"" to have then?  Is it a singular brand or is spread out between Lexus/BMW/Infiniti?  I ask because I don't know anyone my age that aspires to own a Lexus, even though one of my best friends has one.  He has a 1995 SC300 that looks as if spent most of its life in a museum because he pushes around a beater for the daily grind.   People I know find Lexus to be an old mans car through and through.  Its either MB/BMW/Infiniti and to a lesser degree Acura, with Audi bringing up the rear.   Even my friend that has a Lexus doesn't want another one because nothing in their current line appeals to him, they're all to boring.   He might would go for a SC430, but a LexusLS not on his life. Do we all wish (or aspire) to buy the high-end MB or BMW of choice? Yep.  Here BMW and MB are the #1 aspirational luxury cars by far, with Infiniti coming on strong.  The reality of it is however, 3Series/C-CLK/G35/TL/A4     Lexus' high- end cars like the lsand SCaren't even thought about.  Lexus not being a factor may change with the new IS, because I think the whole thing centers on age more than anything else since my circle appears to be at least 10 years younger than yours. Everyone else I know with a Lexus is either over 50 or retired, except for some RX owners (women). M"
"Because they are not the same cars...What Lexus is the Rav 4...Or the Chevy that you showed...Even the Camery which shares a platform with LexusES only shares 25% of the LexusES total content...Further all the Models shown were old and out of date most from the 90S.But you see, all of those cars were Toyotas. Toyota and Lexus are the same company, so you shouldn't expect ""Lexus"" to be held to a higher standard of safety than the rest of the Toyota line. Yes most of those are older models, but think of it this way: If it took Toyota/Lexus this long to get their frontal crash tests in order (which they prepare for in advance), how can you expect them to perform in real world crashes where they aren't held accountable through testing?Are you saying that A8 and Mercedes S have better performance..When you have already acknowledge that Lexus lshas better Acceleration...it has better 0-60 times then Audi...Sorry but 0-60 times aren't the only measure of performance. I would rather have a car that handles and stops well (S) than an unbalanced whale that screeches its way around the track (LS). And trust me, if the SClass loses to the LexusLS in 0-60 times, you can be sure that an SClass/S55/S600 will walk all over it in this regard. I don't know much about the Audi A8 so I can't vouch for it, but my instinct tells me that it probably outperforms the lsin most, if not all, quantitative and qualitative areas of performance. Here are a few of my favorite quotes concerning the chart topping performance of the poised and atheltic ls: &#147;skidpad grip was weakest of all, 0.73 g;&#148; &#147;Tires eager to squeal?never very involving on the back roads."" In contrast, the SClass and others were universally lauded: &#147;Mercedes was endowed with road grip exceeded only by that of the BMW;&#148; &#147;Three cars in the group (Mercedes, BMW, Audi) stand above the others, having braking distances of 169 feet or better, and skidpad adhesion above 0.82 g;&#148; &#147;Benz gave a first-rate account of itself as it slipped through the lane-change test at 57.4 mph... 4.3 better than the slow-guy Lexus.&#148; Safety...We have had that discussion and determined neither car has an edge..even though Mercedes invented Air Bags....40 years ago.Actually, the SClass does have an edge for safety. Unlike corner cutting Lexus, Mercedes includes rear side airbags as a standard feature in the S as well as across the model line. Also, the SClass has pre-safe as standard equipment while Lexus makes you pay for their pre-collision system.  And regarding the entire model line, Mercedes has a safety advantage on every car (Standard belt ETDs, standard belt load limiters, standard rear side airbags, standard rollover protection, etc). Lexus likes to skimp and trim on safety as can be seen throughout its model range, but I think this is perhaps most evident with the SC430... A $65k convertible that will literally grind your head off if it flips. The SClass on the other-hand, has had the handy pop-up roll bar since 1989, as does the current CLK. Another interesting tidbit is that the side airbags on the SClass and CLK (front and rear) are large enough to protect the head and the torso, whereas the side airbags on the SC430 (front only) protect just the torso... Looks like Lexus needs to do some more R&D with all that money they're making. I won't even get into the fact that Lexus is consistently 2-4 years behind the curve when it comes to adopting the new safety technology pioneered by other companies.Just add up what we know about MB and Lexus and the answer is clear... or at least it should be if you have an open mind. Apparently you would rather ride in a car built by Lexus, the company slow to adopt safety features, the company with fewer standard/optional safety items, the company with a history of imitation and non-innovation. I would much rather ride in a car built by Mercedes, the company always on the cutting edge of safety, the company with the most available safety features , and the company with an unrivaled reputation for safety innovation. To each his own?. ?"
"C&D included a pre-refresh MB SClass without the new 7 speed transmission and chose the smallest engine available, theSClass, when a more fair comparison would have been the SClass.In what way is it fair to compare a 5.0 liter engined car against a 4.3 liter engined car, when both are available in 4.3 liter versions?  Is this an Aryan concept of fairness or something?  Maybe it was unfair to test a 4.3 against another 4.3 because the MB lost, when everyone knows that MB is really better and really ""should"" win?If down the road a 2006  RX  loses a comparo to a 2006 ML350, can I just say, ""that was unfair, they should have tested the RX400h against the ML350""?As for the 7-speed tranny, even with it the SClass is notably slower than a 6-spd LexusLS, 6.9 seconds vs 5.9 sec, 0-60."
"But you are mistaken to say that Mercedes sales haven't grown as fast as Lexus because of price.  Mercedes sales haven't grown as fast a Lexus, because Lexus outsold Mercedes in market segments where, in general, they are considered competitors. Well Lexus outselling Mercedes is twofold.  First MB, to their own detriment misjudged the SUV market with the body-on-frame M-Class, which also was cost-cut to death to get it down to a Ford Explorer price, which gave it the worst quality scores in MB's history.   This right here is the major reason Lexus outsells MB, because MB (and the Germans in general) were slow to spot the SUV trend and react.  Score a huge one for Lexus. The part about price is where I will simply never agree.  The LexusLS outselling theSClass, is in part due to a price advantage.  I mean take away everything else and you have a car that starts at 57K going against what was until April (S350 is entry level now) of this year a 77K car in theSClass.  All I'm saying is that has to account for something.  How much so I don't know, but to say it doesn't matter is false.  To make a such a broad statement about Lexus outselling MB in general in segments where they are competitors isn't true either.  While the ES330 is an entry-level luxury car, its mission and focus isn't really in tune with any other European or Japanese luxury car company's entry level products.  In short, no one else is chasing the LexusES or even considers it a competitor, at least not enough of one to warrant producing such a uninvolving car.   The IS and GS, where MB and Lexus are more of direct competitors, MB outsells them easily so that statement about where they are both competitors doesn't really hold true when you look at all the models. Something tells me that if MB hadn't dropped the ball in SUV, the sales race would be a lot more interesting because MB has the better sales on the car side already, in most cases where MB/Lexus prices line up more cleanly. Does MB face an uphill battle of catching up because of the recently acquired rep for poor reliablity?  Yes.  Back in 1998 the word hadn't got out yet so they would have really had a chance to maintain their lead over Lexus in sales, if they had a better SUV and didn't wait until the 2006 model year to add a crossover.

"certain BMW models dragged down all of BMWA somewhat valid point if you're a customer for one of the more reliable models.

"Despite it's many sophisticated electronic devices, trick suspension, AWD, complicated powertrain, and precious construction, I have not had not one issue with my a8 W12. Yes it's very German, but very reliable, not something I can say about the two Japanese ls's I've ownedIMO, Audi is just out of the gate in its ascension.  Audi will be one of the more exciting German marks to watch over the next few years and decade.  TagMan"
"Does Porsche sell more vehicles than Ferrari? It makes no difference, as one of the marques is more likely to raise my pulse when it goes flying by.Just an FYI. This board discusses the 7-, A8, LexusLS, Jag, etc level of cars. Only within THIS class of cars are we debating the sales numbers. So there is no need to extend these beyond the confines of HELM. We are not debating Porsches and Ferraris here. Pls use the example pertinent here. When we say the LexusLS is #1 luxury full-size car in America, that is within HELM scope, and is correct. So of the cars in HELM, which one would you rather own ? Not one you'd rather dream about, but one you'll actually BUY."
"Don't want or not seeing the need for is the marketting equivalent of ""balking at."" With the flood of free money from the FED nowadays, anyone with a paying job can afford to ride in an LexusLS, S or 7 nowadays, whether people actually do it is all that matters as far as the companies are concerned. I'll be awaiting some of this ""free money"".  You're grasping here, really.  My point about the 545i vs its cheaper siblings is that you don't know for sure what the reason for its lower sales are.   I'm sure price is a factor for someone looking at a 525i.  We can only guess, but my point is that C&D isn't a market research firm, they're auto testers and they should know better.    If you aren't going to compare similar cars then whats the point.  The market prefers the ES330 and 3Series in huge numbers too, doesn't make them ""competitors"".  Porsche doesn't offer a V8 sports car and their situation relative to their competition is like totally irrelevant.   Sports cars like the 911 and its competitors line up even worse when looking at price.  Totally irrelevant bringing up Porsche. What's there to weep? Didn't you just say 545i is better handling in 530i in just about any category aside from linear accelearation? So R&T biased towards linear accelearation, big deal . . . NOT.Plenty.  It proves my point about the GS430 not being the 5Series competitior as a sports sedan, like I stated at the beginning.  Read the article.  No I didn't say the 545i was better in handling over the 530i.  You've got it backwards.  I clearly stated that the 530i is likely better handling than 545i because of less weight.  Please go back and read the post.  You tried to imply that it made no difference as to whether the 530i or 545i was compared to the GS430, yet when the right car is compared (545i) to the GS430, the GS430 gets beat, when sport sedans are the topic.   Kinda destroys that extension theory.  The R&T article isn't biased towards acceleration either.   They looked at far more than just acceleration and I think you know Road and Track isn't that type of magazine.  You know they use a scoring system and a car could do 0-60 in 3 secs and still not win overall.   I suspect you know this.   You stated that you hadn't seen the 545i vs. the GS430 yet so you should probably read the article first. M"
"Speaking of ignorance, quoting me days supply on an AWD model from last Winter means you have no idea what days supply for it is NOW!  OF COURSE days supply for it will be low in the Winter, up North.    Since I now live in the Sun Belt, supply far outreaches demand for the A8.  Fewer are shipped here, but still they sit quite a while.  Haven't seen one on the road in months.  Your days supply might be less.  Mine is definitely quite high, especially now that it's 95 degrees!   When I lived in New York, I'd see a few.  But AWD has little value, and hurt acceleration and economy down here.     I could give a Rat's tail what Audi does outside of the US!  This isn't Double-A ball!  You want status of Lexus and BMW, you have to earn it.  Audi hasn't done that here.  Quality studies, sales, and US perception (going back to the Audi 5000 ""Unintended acceleration"" debacle) say 2nd-Tier, US, loud & proud.   Plenty of companies make very fine cars.     It takes a little more to be 1st-Tier.   As far as US being imbeciles, let's keep politics out of this, shall we?   DrFill"
"E on the other hand is bread and butter of MB (well, in the prestigeous past anyway, before C took over the bulk of sales). Both E and C are being heavily discounted, and both are actually newer than LS320 and ES330; the Lexi have not even bothered with engine/badge updates like MB has since their model introduction years ago. The lsand C-Class both came out for 2001 so they're the same age in fact.   EClass  has the unfortunate position of suddenly being the next to oldest car in a class that has been completely transformed since 2004.  The 5Series, A6, RL, GS, M, and STS are all newer so it would be expected for the E to face an uphill battle.  You act as though this can't happen to anyone else.  Lexus' 1998-2005 GS was just as discounted and towards the end it didn't sell much at all, unlike  EClass  which no matter what its age is always stays either #1 or #2 in the sales race. BTW, the ES330 is only a year older than  EClass  but more importantly the ES330 has a segment nearly to itself, hardly a valid comparison.  No foreign luxury brand makes a fwd-bluehair set car to compete with the ES330. M"
"Especially considering the LexusLS doesn't sticker or sell at the SClass and 7Series' base price  ? I'm sure Len can correct you on this, but methinks you miss the point. Except for the SClass, the A8, 745, LexusLS, SClass all lease roughly within same range (give-or-take a couple hundred bucks), with either low interest rates (MB/BMW) or higher residuals (LS). Meaning: even a higher stickered A8 leases for less than the lower priced LexusLS. So who cares about what the cars stickered at ? What are they selling/leasing for ?  ?Now, a car that should be in this discourse is the Phaeton. Nice car. Beautifully appointed. I sat in one at the SD auto show last month. What a car ! Its a shame its badged as a VW, otherwise it should do extremely better than the A8. But sadly, I hear its on its way out. What a loss to the buying public who never really got to find out how good this car could be...."
"Excuse me, Merc1, but Len's the resident business exec here and his inputs are very much appreciated. On this HELM board, every angle to the car business is looked at, not a one-track driving/handling/performance/HP angle you'd prefer. You should be sorry indeed... Whooptie do!  Let&#146;s just say I disagree with the timing of these &#147;business&#148; inputs more than the viewpoints themselves, though in this case I don't think there was a point at all at least not anything really enlightening.   Pluhease,  you act as though that little tidbit was heaven sent. Heck I could have told you that by just looking at the numbers, that most of the growth was due to new models. That is common sense when a company introduces as many new models as MB has in the past year.  The whole thing was irrelevant at best, IMO.  It really seems mightily coincidental that this ""business"" angle comes up in the negative about MB anytime one mentions an MB accomplishment. And while we are on the topic of MB, Merc1, can you explain why MB sells the new SClass as an  SClass here in Japan, while its an  SClass in the US, especially since both are rated at 387HP ? What gives here ???? My guess would be that MBUSA wanted to keep the badging more accurate or they felt that ""550"" would sound better than ""500"" on a new car.  They may have thought that some wouldn't see a new ""500"" as an upgrade so they went with ""550"" instead. I dunno. BTW, in a May 2006 car mag here, the LS600hL is pegged at 430HP, with standard 245/45/19"" rims, compared to the 387HP SClassL, with standard 255/45/18"" rims. The LS600hL however outweighs the S by over 200Ibs... Ouch ! Must be that hybrid motor in the 600hL, eh ? Well I'm sure that is where they'll need to price for it to be competitive because it appears the LS600hL doesn't stand a chance against a 510hp SClass when it comes to performance.M"
"First let me be quite clear here. I do NOT care about being credible with YOU. Obviously you have a huge ego about yourself, more power to you. You are a poster here like everyone else. As to reliability, wow... where do one start ? There is too much track record here of your statements.... Lets just let sleeping dogs lie. Thats all fine and good, problem is posting incorrect sales figures, statements about Mercedes safety systems failing and how they invited journalist to come and watch are extremely mis-leading at best, to say the least.  It does a great diservice to readers who tend to believe any and everything they read on the internet and if it weren't for others double checking most of this stuff it would be left to stand as fact, when it couldn't be any further from the truth. It all depends on what you want in a car. Sportier than others suggests others are aiming for sportiness in their products. What if they aren't ? What if each car is biased towards some strength of its maker ? What you have no clue about is market/product differentiation. A product that doesn't differentiate itself is doomed to failure. Do you even remotely get this ?? So pls stop the *ultimate* driving machine sloganeering. It only matters to those who target such feature.It seems to me that BMW has proven over and over that they are just that, the ultimate driving machine.  Now since Lexus opened their big mouth and said they were targeting this and failed we get this spin about this slogan only meaning something to people that BMWs appeal to!  You're kidding!  I thought that was the whole reason for having a slogan or advertising in the first place - to reach a core group of people or a select audience.   All the irrelevancy about customer service and what not the Lexus fans constantly tout likewise only matters to people who place such things above all else.  Lexus' strength and differentiators are luxury, refinement, reliability and customer service. And that's why they have been so hugely successful. BMW may appeal to *sportiness* and that may make them successful. MB may appeal to heritage and marqueness, and that may be enough for them to be successful.  Who is arguing with this?  You act as though no other car other than a Lexus is luxurious or reliable.  The truth is that other cars are just that, at least enough to keep their buyers interested.  The ridiculous theory about Lexus selling so many cars and being so perfect because of that is just plain silly when other brands are in the same sales ballpark, esepcially BMW.  That alone tells you that their are other factors besides reliability and customer service that sells these cars. Yep. MBs are more in touch with the road than Lexus ! You an say that with a straight face ? Have you owned or driven extensively an  SClass and LexusLS to judge that ? Or is it what you read in auto mags ? Nope, don't need to own a car to know how it drives. Another fallacy given here constantly, that you have to own a car to know how it drives.  You're able to tell how a 3Series  drives from a test drive of a few minutes, or at least to be able to tell it drives sportier, but no one else is able to do the same with a test drive of a LexusLS vs the competition.  I've driven the LexusLS a few times now and the SClass many times and my opinions on both as to how they drive are based on such driving experience.  Don't need to own one to see and feel how they drive, don't be ridiculous.  If I made a statement about which car was more reliable or disputed the fact that the lsshows to be more reliable in survey - then I'd need to own one of them of both.  Not to know that the LexusLS keeled over like a barge at Lexus' own test drive event. You are simply looking for something to trump out as non-credible. The post of mine you quote stated NOTHING about a timeline. I said lswas outselling S + 7Series COMBINED. Did I tell you which year that was, or like your colleague, you simply assumed I meant 2005 YTD. So when I specified the timeline, why not prove that wrong instead of denigrating my post ? If you have the facts for 2004 why not present it ? Well it really doesn't require much ""looking"" to see the hype often presented here.  Sales figures YTD that have been light by one month for the non-Lexus brand or articles about safety equipment failing without the whole story being posted - nothing but hype. Lastly, this about Lexus and their product differenation skills is a joke.  They have 4 sedans and 3 SUVs, yet they're so diversified as to make them all boring (except the IS350) and drive more or less alike (again except the IS350), yeah that is product ""differentiation"" alright.  Seems to me they've made their success on making the same type of product for different segments not because they offer something from everyone as you try to imply.  People looking for sporty car that isn't small like the IS or a sporty car without 4-doors are out of luck at a Lexus store.   Seems to me product diversity is something they're only just now trying to do with sportier cars like the IS and to a lesser degree the new GS.  Until now all they had was boring, yawnish sedans and even more drole SUVs. Oh, If BMWs aren't the ultimate driving machines in the luxury segment then what brand is?  It certainly isn't Lexus.  Yet if someone were to suggest that the ultimate in luxury is a Lexus, this would be gladly excepted as some type of fact.  If BMW isn't the maker of the ultimate driving machine from the 325i all the way up to a 760i Sport, then who is?M"
"For the first time in a long time, I have to sharply disagree with you: Gotta happen sometime HMM? Wasn't it in 1989 when Toyota had not ONE HELM in NA and deciding to come up with Lexus, with LexusLS and ES250? And this was all supposed to be done in a timeframe of 2 years? Blkhemi: I do respect your posts and knowledge, so permit me to disagree with you, somewhat, as well.When Toyota introduced Lexus in 1989, it was leveraging on a history and reputation of Toyota's solid build quality and reliability. The Corolla was a staunch staple of low-end compact buyers, the LC was legendary for its solid build and off-road prowress, and the Camry was inching up the steep curve of family sedan leadership. OTOH, what does Hyundai have that could shoot them through the warp space of acceptability: The Sonata - a blatant copy of an Accord, tho' solid build, quality of materials still look dated and subpar, but acceptable at its price point. The SUVs are all copy-cats, no originality whatsoever. The Azerra is too new to make a dent in anything for now. That market is owned by the Avalon, Buick, and Ford. So Hyundai needs to be fighting on many fronts:Small-midsized SUV - against Rav4/Highlander/RX/4Runner, etc.Minivan - against T&C, Sienna, Oddy, etcFamily sedan - against Camry, Accord, the perennial leaders, new Fusion, etcFull-size sedan - against Avalon, Lucerne, Ford 500, Chrysler 300, etc..And this does not include starting a luxury arm... Honda and Nissan, despite their reputations, have not found Toyota/Lexus' level of success in the HELM space, what's gonna make Hyundai overcome the huge challenges of the likes of Lexus, BMW, MB, Audi, Jag, etc...? Does Hyundai even have the deep pockets required to battle the big boys ? And what reputation does it have beyond SKorea and the US ? At least Toyota is everywhere in the world, more or less - Africa, Asia, Europe, America, Australia, Middle East. Hyundai challenging in HELM in 5 years ???? I don't see this happening in a 5-yr time frame. Not that it cannot happen, just the timeline is where I disagree with."
"Further more, you and the other LexIthinkIcans can rant about Audi all you want, but the laughs will stop soon enough, especially when the supposed ""dominator"" LS600h 15 minutes of stardom wears off. For all it's technology, 430hp is akin to a 4-cylinder engine nowadays in this class. Sure it has hybrid, but why does it only get 3mpg better on the hwy than my W-12 with 450hp? Seems like yet another frivilous offer from Lexus again... BlkHemi: I think the HSD can be thought of in tow ways - mpg and performance. Sure you do get some bump-up in MPG but the real story is in the improved performance of the car. The GS450h is a far better performance sedan than its brethren GS300 with same n/a V6 motor. Ditto the 600h will out-perform its brethren 460L when both gets here. But I do not want to point this out too much, if your V-12 A8 W12 puts down 450hp, Lexus's V8-H is doing about same with 4-less cylinders.... The torque number for the 600h should be interesting. I hope it tops 450Ibft... Lastly, key factoids will be the suspension in the 600h, the gearing ratios of the manumatic CVT 8-speed, and how those low-profile 19"" rims will work smoothly, quietly, luxuriously, and yet with better performance all rolled into one. That would be the marvel of this car, assuming Lexus can do this.I am no Audi basher, btw. I have nothing against Audi, never has. I may not like the tootie grin of the front grill design, but I don't mind the rest of the package, even MMI. My beef is with the over-hyping of MB due to its supposed better handling/performance with its mainstream sedans..."
"FWIW, BMW sells more of the ""Li"" vs ""i"" at a rate of 2.5-to-1... Wow, that's an interesting statistic and says a lot about why Lexus would want to have a LWB model.  Are the numbers similar for the Audi A8 vs. A8L?Thanks to all of you for helping me see the light.  I now understand the the LWB is perfect for a chauffeur-driven celebrity real estate executive who sits in a baby seat and needs frequent massages.    I guess it's all part of the American psyche that says ""more is better"".  I am still enough of an urbanite to think that 4"" more in length cuts me out of that many more parallel parking spots, and can only add to the limitations on drivability (although obviously these manufacturers are using a lot of technology to make up for the size - apparently with much success).  If I really needed that space I certainly would be willing to pay for it (for example, if I and my kids were all 6'4"" plus).I can tell you one thing for sure: if I end up with an lsin the future, I won't be getting the passenger side-only footrest option; there is no way I am going to listen to my teenagers arguing over who is going to sit on that side!"
"Contrary to your negative views of the 2006 GS, a greater majority of those who have actually seen this car in person liked it much better than the pics showed.""But did you? What does the majority have to do with anything?  Lexus buyers will adore anything Lexus makes regardless of how it looks, the LexusLS, LexusES, RX prove that.  You seem to imply that I haven't seen the car in person. I saw it over a year ago and again this year and now on the road, and its and ugly whale of a car, imo. ""The new GS is better than any of the Bangled BMWs out there today. No contest there. MBs and Audis are always pretty sharp, style-wise, I give you that. But I have repeatedly told you that MB styling only got better in the 90s. The older MBs are stodgy, slab-sided, but highly functional, rock-solid build and of excellent overall quality. Its only in the '90s MB began the styling direction with their bug-eyed E-series. So, let's give Lexus its due props... The company is only 15 years in the Luxury car/truck business, unlike BMW and MB's long heritage of producing crappy-looking, but highly efficient automobiles until much recently.All highly IYO because while I won't pretend that MBs always looked as good as they do now, but they were far from crappy looking.  Going by how 80s Toyotas used to look and that first ES250 Lexus' cars would have looked even worse than those slab-sided Benzes.  I find nothing wrong with the looks of the 1981-1991 SClass or the SEC coupe from the same years, timeless to me. The 1986-1995EClass also had a timeless Mercedes look, especially the 300CE/E320 Coupe from those years (1988-1995).  Hardly ""crappy"" looking. Toyota on the other hand has long been a the very bottom on the styling scale.  Stylewise Lexus hasn't earned any ""props"" with me since the original SC300/400 and until I see this new IS in person...Yes I'm one of the few that like the new 5Series, but I still can't stand the 7Series.  My problem with the 5Series isn't styling so I don't think the GS looks better in that regard. Styling it seem as everyhing else reverts back to Lexus and Toyotas profits and how they're going to take over the world.  Time for a new line as that one is past tired.  All the money in the world doesn't always mean the best products, maybe from a reliability standpoint, but not even Toyota/Lexus has hit all homeruns with every product. M"
"Guess my opinion that the current SClass was the best styled in the current group was irrelevant and funny too. What is funny to me is your opinion. Reading thru the lines it's quite clear to me that you know the S took a wrong turn in styling but you keep trying to dress up your wording to make it sound otherwise. You couldn't say anything other than that previous SClass was the best styled car in the class - anyone sighted could see that.  My point was that anyone who even remotely thought any Lexus, especially the LexusLS was a good looking car or a car with a ""classic look"" can't really talk about the new SClass looking bad or taking a turn for the worse, when Lexus has done far worse - and it was accepted as being a ""classic look"".   How hypocritical is that? My point.  Lexus fans convincing themselves that a car like the LexusLS had a ""classic"" look when the look was anything but, is ""dressing up"" the wording.  The new S is ""ugly"" according to you but the LexusLS has a ""classic look"".  That isn't biased?  Right. I'll give you that the new SClass in base form isn't as good looking as the outgoing model but ugly it ain't and in AMG trim (just like the outgoing model) it is stunning.  Thats my opinion.  M"
"Having the Maybach and SClass virtually share taillights, or the C-Class and SClass of a generation ago, is not a good thing, as it says cost-cutting to the trained eye. Yeah this is a good example.  Now if this were true, why doesn't it mean the same thing for Lexus?  Lexus is doing the same thing with design from model to model.  Anyway, the cars you mention don't have the exact same taillights in the way they could be changed out from car to car like you suggest.  Totally off there doc. Sure Lexus' new designs are better than what they used to be, well except for the still awful looking (side view) GS, but they aren't up to Mercedes' outgoing S or currentEClass yet.  Not by a long shot.  The CLS flat out stomps holes in anything from Lexus. Have you taken a good look the new ES?  Nothing more than a collection of LS/IS cues with even more slab siddedness.   But I guess you'd only mistake one Audi model for another, but not Lexus because they're still different enough from model to model right?  Right. A 1995 7Series better looking than the 2000SClass?  Ok. In AMG trim the outgoing S had no equals in styling until the current A8 came along. The 5Series I like also, but I wouldn't call it the sexiest sedan on the road.  It is edgy, aggressive and mean looking in the BMW tradition with a much better rear than the 7Series. You've got that about the 92 SClass way, way backwards, it was poorly done 2001 replica LexusLS that was past its prime mimicing a car ""designed in the 1980's"" as you put it.  M"
"GS and IS, even in their best years, could not begin to compare to LexusES and RX sales. The same can not be said ofEClass. That's why GS and IS in their waning years was nearly as significant the decline ofEClass. It will next time they do since they GS and now IS are big contributers to Lexus' sales now.  You won't be able to fall back on this excuse if and when they start to decline in a few years.   EClass ' decline was to be expected in the face of 5 freshly minted competitors!  Same thing happened with the previous GS, only thing different is the timing and the numbers of new competitors in the last 12-18 months. We all know what one of the main reasons they LexusLS outsells the rest of the class is, but of course you'll just say price doesn't matter since everyone can lease so I'm done with that. Also, isn't proper managing of production and maintain brand/model prestige what a luxury marque maker supposed to do? Flooding the market with cars that need heavy discount does not jive well with maintaining marque value.Yes it is. Finally something I can agree with.  Why they added the S350 this year is beyond me since there won't be a 2007 S350 version of the newSClass.  I guess they didn't want to drop the sales title to the 7Series in the final year of the W220 production. IS300 actually did quite well in the first couple model years. There was no heavy discounting in the first couple model years like what's available on R-class today, within a few short months after introduction. Yeah sure, quite well compared to what?  Not the 3Series or any other cars it targeted.  Lexus simply deciding to let the car die instead of discounting is their choice. I think the truth of the matter is that even with discounts no one wanted the previous generation IS300.  It wasn't like they held it at MSRP and settled for small sales.  They discounted the thing and it still didn't move!  Like I said, the verdict is still out on the R-Class, being a few months old. BTW, the first generation GS300 was quite a different animal from the GS that we know since 1998. Excuses, excuses.  The 1993 GS300 is much like the 2006 GS300, slow.  The only difference/addition to the GS lineup since the beginning is the addition of a V8, the GS400 and then GS430, which very few people bought during the 1998-2005 model's production run.  M"
"Here was the sales chart. Lexus was up 9% overall - I misread something before. Amazing though how Lexus has transformed to big car sales this year and this is with an lson life support given the big changes with the new model. Quite. Notice that the LexusES beat the RX in sales? I'm sure it wont last, but it is interesting to see nonetheless."
"However, this time I will possibly expand my lsreplacement search to include the A8 and the 7Series (if the new redo gets here by next year).750 isn&#146;t on the left coast? They&#146;ve been around for a while around here. A colleague of mine just got one."
"I am willing to wager that after the first year of intro, lssales will fizzle and fall flat like Coca Cola sitting in a glass for three days! Have sales of the current ls""fizzled""?  No, in fact the ratio of lssales to S or 7 sales has I believe INCREASED over the past 5 or so years.  Note that even though the current lsis ""older"" (further along in its lifecycle) than the 7, it handily outsells the 7.Well, if you're truly ""willing to wager"", put your money where your mouth is.  Here's a proposal:  I bet you that the lsstill outsells the 7, say in the calendar year 2010.  We engage a lawyer to hold bets in escrow.  Minimum bet $5k.  Send an email to me via Pat (host) if you are interested (just request that it be forwarded to me)."
"Hmmmm....Looks like LG has come up with a fairly comprehensive list blkhemi. Who was that spouting off about Lexus being a rebadged Toyota? And what is that they say about people who live in glass houses? I think this one will leave a mark!! I believe it was hpowders, he likes to pick on the lsto try and get ""team Japan"" agitated. It really doesn't work. The lshas a Lexus specific platform, engine, and gearbox. Just like Audi, they platform share with entry level products such as the LexusES and RX in order to keep costs down, ultimately benefitting the consumer."
"I didn&#146;t say the top view was the driver view. Essentially, I said that it contains the IMPRESSION I will see when I finally get to sit in the driver&#146;s seat. It is the shot that gives me the sense of actual proportions, dimensions and ambience. Actually, I think Len was right the first time on this issue.  First, I have to say that we haven't actually sat in the new car yet, so we are really all just speculating.  And certainly, as designman said, pictures can lie.  But the low perspective of the first pic is not one that the driver would ever see to create any impression.  I am pretty confidant of that based on experience with the current model, which has a very similar long lower expanse on the passenger side.  What isn't so obvious is that most of the lower mass drops away towards the front of the car, so it doesn't show up to either the passenger or the driver nearly as much as this picture seems to suggest.  For example, the items on the lower part of the driver's side can't be seen at all by the driver; as a matter of fact, one of my complaints is you have to feel your way to hitting the gas tank flap opening button - there is no way you can see it without twisting your body way down low.And I actually like the shape of the center stack more than in the current model.  To my eye, the NAV and electronics at the top of the stack coordinate much better with the lower portion; the one thing I don't like about the current version is that there is no smooth transition from the dash materials at the top to the wood panels below.  The vertical ribbon of buttons along the sides in the new version better pull the whole stack together.I also like the more monotone color of the display model better than the high-contrast two-tone version in the pics you posted (even though both my lsand my MB E have the similar two tone beige/taupe theme).Yikes, now I'm disagreeing with designman and, perhaps, Len, too.  Next, Pat is going to brand me a troll!"
"I do think the car will sell in numbers greater than any of the V12 Germans, though. Possibly greater than all of them added together. Yeah I think so too, especially if they price it at 100K or less, when a SClass is 40K more and the 760Li almost 20K more. What are the specs for the LS460's trunk space?M"
"I don't think the time or configuration is right for the S450 right now...I don't think you've gone too far with this because you're saying the exact same thing I was suggesting about adding a S450 right, it would do more harm than good, IMO. So you are saying a single  SClass model is enough to hold off the LS460, LS460L, LS600hL, 7Series, 7SeriesL, A8, A8L, XJ ?? Methinks not. MB needs another one to supplement the  SClass pretty quick. By next spring, the LS600hL arrives here, and MB suddenly has 3 lsseries sedans to battle against using one SClass, or maybe a possibleSClass. But MB is known to have far more variants than Lexus, so it'd be strange if the role is reversed, don't you think ? And I don't count the very low volume S63/S65 here."
"I firmly believe that lsshould move from ""Value HELM"" to ""premium HELM"" in line with 7Series and A8. This is because this is the natural outcome of evolution in LS's life. I agree Lexus can move up the price ladder...they have been doing so for the last 17 years...but I don't expect them to necessarily move to parity with the 7 in 4-5 months.  Though it could happen that soon, it could alternatively take years more.  And I'm not about to second-guess Lexus management if they decide not to do it in 4-5 months.  There can be sound business reasons for pricing lower than the competition, even for luxury goods."
"I see your point that lexus had to offer cut-rate prices to win market share and awareness, but now that it has all of that, I see now reason why lsshould offer cut-rate pricing anymore. Well, you are making progress here.     Yes, you see that Lexus had to offer cut-rate prices to gain market share and awareness, but what you are describing is the""value"" associated with that awareness.  Steve, it is an integral part of the Lexus success formula.  There have been countless hours of discussions about this on this forum.  Many before I came on board and many since.  The U.S. Lexus strategy is about that ""value"" perception.  Without it, some may still choose the Lexus, but the equation takes a deep dive into a different direction, and it is absurd for Lexus to change a winning formula.  Only a car like the LS600hL can take a slight detour from the strategy because it is unique enough and offers something BEYOND the competition in a certain sense.  But even with that car, to venture too far off the successful path would be business suicide.  From a business standpoint, there is no good reason to fix it when it isn't broken.  In fact, it is FAR from broken . . . it is a well-oiled machine, a Swiss watch, a comet in orbit . . . something that just works almost too good to be true.  To change the formula would be downright stupid, IMO.Take it a step further.  Just considering the way that many Lexus fans think that Lexus vehicles could be priced higher is, in itself, a perfect example of the achievement of the ""value"" perception.  It is, by definition, the whole point. If Lexus fans did not think that Lexus vehicles could be priced more, than the entire ""value"" perception would not exist, would it?  Do you get it?  It is an integral part of the strategy and formula.  In other words, Lexus fans think that way because they are doing exactly what Lexus has in mind for them.It brings up the question: is this ""value"" perception a ""perception"" or ""misperception""?  That is more subjective, but I will tell you that it is a genuine perception, and it must be for the formula to work.  Lexus vehicles are in fact a great value.But, a great ""value"" doesn't make them equivalent in all regards.  It makes them what they are, and no more or no less.  The new lsmodels will continue in the same brilliant fashion . . . they will be terrific ""values"", maybe even MORE so than previous generations.Again, ""value"" is an essential and integral part of Lexus strategy.  Get used to it.  Appreciate it.  Embrace it.Oh . . . one more thing . . . ""value"" doesn't necessarily mean ""better""!!  TagMan"
"I still don't see the point of a GS450h when the GS460 is going to cost likely less with more power. To have a GS450h to save a few gallons of gass with a much smaller trunk than the already too small trunk of the GS430? Doesn't really make sense to me. Then there is the fact that Lexus will only sell 2K units a year, hardly enough for any other luxury maker to take the GS450h seriously.There may NOT be a GS460 afterall... Lexus may simply one-up the market by putting the 5L V8 in the new GS and IS, and make these the sporty versions, while the GS450H becomes the cousin to the 2007 GS350 arriving this Fall.Now the LS600h may be a different story, but the SClass obviously has nothing worry about nor does the 760Li, but the LS600h does make an interesting alternative to the SClass/750Li. Still speculation for now, but something tells me MB is not thinking like you. They will see the LS600hL as a direct competitor to theSClass. The LS460L is a match for the SClass/7SeriesL, so expect the 600hL to go right against theSClass/760iL/A8L... Don't think so ? Just wait and see..."
"I did go way way overboard. I just can't stand that denaliipna and merc1 kept saying MB's style (which is so subjective) is better than Lexus.So you can't stand that denaliipna and merc1 are correct? Yes this is a subjective area, but in my opinion MB styling is much better than Lexus. Lexus has no design identity of its own. All Lexus does is mix and match design elements from other brands to form a bland mutt of a car. For years Lexus has been ripping off Mercedes, but I think the most blatant imitation has to be the current LexusLS, which was heavily influenced by the S. The few times that Lexus has ventued off on its own without holding Mercedes' hand has been disasterous. The LexusES looks like utter trash and the SC430 is quite possibly the ugliest car on the road. Let those people buy those European junk cars. They will learn except for those fanatics. I and all the friends and relatives did learn from mistakes. Does MB know that if Lexus didn't exist, they would sell a lot more cars? Again look at electronics. I used to own German TVs, but now I only buy Japanese. No, you don't sound like a Lexus fanatic at all. Not one bit. In fact, it sounds like you have done plenty of research and applied much logic to support your ""European junk"" claim. :sarcasm: As far as your TV analogy is concerned...Apples and Oranges. Did you know that MB outsells Lexus around the globe and in America MB sells more cars than Lexus? The RX SUV (aka raised Camry) is the only reason why Lexus total sales in the U.S. are higher than MB. All that will change shortly with the new M-class Even if MB were the same price as Lexus, I think Lexus still beats MB in safety, value and reliability (all objective criteria).Reliability and value maybe. But definitely not safety. Please, I am interested in your logic as to why Lexus is safer than MB. Is it because Lexus never innovates in safety? Is it because Lexus is slow to adopt safety features? Is it because Lexus doesn't offer as many safety features as MB? That is a very interesting perspective indeed... :/ Especially considering that MB spanks Lexus in all three areas: Innovation/Introduction/Features"
"I still feel you are looking at this the 'old fashioned' way, in that companies operate by designing and building what they think a product should be for a particular segment. That's bassackwards in plainspeak.  Companies that operate the way you suggest these days struggle to hold customers. The Euros all do this. They've got that old fashioned German scientist engineer thing down pat where they think they know what's best for the customer. Unfortunately, this kind of rocket science has got them in a lot of trouble.  Companies that design cars that their customers buy in droves are in fact designing and building exactly what the market wants, not what they think the market needs. The measure of success is the money they make, the share they gain, the positive press they receive.  Companies that are in trouble financially are failing to make what the market wants. I think you're taking my post out of context.  What I mean is that every luxury car maker has their theory or idea as to what a luxury car should be, not that they should dictate what the market gets.   All car companies listen to their customers in varying degress, but there are differences.   What Lexus thinks a car should driver, look and feel like is their philosphy at work, ditto for Audi, BMW, Mercedes and every other brand here.  If every brand had the same ideas we have a bunch of Lexus like cars or all BMW type cars.  I didn't say that MB or anyone else dictates what type of car the customer should have, rather its that each brand has a take on the luxury car theme. Also, if Lexus' way was so superior they'd be the bestselling car in every class don't you think?  Yet they're far from it.  The LexusES plays a game no one else is playing, the GS and IS have always had a hard time staying popular so obviously Lexus either doesn't listen to their customers, or they aren't giving what the market wants, going by your theory.   The lshas a good take on the idea of what most would consider an ideal luxury car, plus being priced below its main compeitition equals a hit.   Why do you think MB dumped its boss this week? Because the board thinks the cars don't handle right or ride right? No, I think he failed to realize the hole he had dug and couldn't get them out of it. New management was needed before this turns into their own Little Big HornI agree with you here, had nothing to do with car design.  He was let go because MB has been tarnished badly under his reign, mainly because of quality problems, which isn't what I'm talking about above. M"
"I test drove the GS430 yesterday. It is absolutely spectacular and I'm trying to figure out a reason to lease one. Lexus hit it perfect as far as I'm concerned. Driving the car made me realize how easily Lexus could have pushed it further (quite easily) on the sport handling side. But then they would have lost some of that great luxury ride feel. As it is they gave a great and perfect balance to both sides of the fence for a car in this class. Sorry but after reading that I would say the same bias applies to you, or either you don't understand what a proper sports sedan  is supposed to be.  The GS was supposed to be a 5Series fighter and it is not, but of course you find it to be perfect.  I'm biased for not liking a GS, yet I'm able to admit and post what I honestly think of every Mercedes, whether it is favorable or not.   You on the other hand think that every Lexus product is perfect and that the isolated/sound system/nav combo can't be had anywhere else.  This to me is a ""shame"" imo.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I find the Lexus GX470 and SC430 to be interesting vehicles and if I were a buyer in those markets I'd drove those Lexi, but the GS imo is about the ugliest car in the segment and on other things that appeal to me (not you) the GS is behind the M45, A6, E, and 5Series.  Saying you drove it and you realized how much more ""easily Lexus could have pushed it further (quite easily) on the sport handling side"" to me shows more bias than anything I've said.  You've basically invented an excuse for the car not being sporty enough to challenge the rival Lexus fingered.   If I had said something like that about a Mercedes the board would be up in arms about me making excuses for the MB not achieving its goal.   How much they could have made it sportier?  That sir is an incredible bias. Can't even admit that they failed as a ""sports sedan"" only to get beat by a fellow Asian brand in that regard. BTW, I'll be in line to drive the new IS250 like everyone else.  Very excited and interested in such a car, but obviously it doesn't apply to this set. I know you don't care about sport, but that is what Lexus stated for this model.  Read the other boards where people don't apply LexusLS type thinking to the GS and you'll see they prefer the M45 and the Lexus doesn't cut it.  Sure it has all the regular Lexus attributes and that is fine for many (obviously), but as a true sports sedan it doesn't cut it. Don't cry ""your not objective"" because I don't think every Lexus is perfect like you do.  I've been more than objective here, well most of the time when the bs isn't being layered on too thickly and I think you know this.  M"
"I think the lsis too good of a car to be supported by such a weak argument that is based on sales volumes, especially when a comparable MB S costs far more.First off, this is a truly weak excuse for the S. I have said repeatedly, and Merc1 also agreed, the lscosts less bcos it is produced more efficiently at a lower cost. Conversely, the S costs more becos it is produced at a higher cost. Except if you are asking MB to sell its high-end marque cars at steep losses... to match the lsin price. This is an MB problem, not Lexus'... Besides didn't C&D (or is it RT) in 2004 comparo of the class leaders had the 2004 LexusLS beat out everyone in its class ? Need a link to that too ?Lower priced luxury cars like the lsdo sell at greater volume than higher priced cars like the MB S.More excuses.... Wrong again. The Land Cruiser is priced anywhere from $5K-$10K LESS than its cousin, the LX470. Guess which sells MORE.... Yep, its the higher-priced LX470.So my question to you again is what makes the lssuperior to the MB S?Lets see again. The lsentered the NA market in 1989, and in 15 short years, became the #1 selling luxury full-size sedan its market. And like I said, the very best from Japan against the very best from Germany. The market spoke, and loudly too.... And many objective tests have shown the lsto be consistently ranked higher than the S."
"I think the post on the LS460 board about the double up of option pricing has some merit if the etter is real. I don't know if the letter is a hoax or is just an energetic salesman. Could be a hoax as a letter like that would usually come from the General Manager of the dealereship and not a person that fails to disclose his or her title. I agree... especially on the part that its not even signed by the GM of the dealership, nor is it directly from Lexus Corporate, so forgive me if I remain skeptical of this letter. A LWB which is NOT the flagship optioned to $94K ??? That seems way out of line for Lexus..."

"I used to work in the liquor industry a long time ago.drinking or marketing?    So it is with diesel - it'll just never get started here and it's so hard to invest in a technology that has been rejected. Hybrids though are a natural and seamless extension of gas.I agree with this, but to a lesser point.  You use the word never regarding the diesels, and when I consider that such a large number of vehicles in Europe are diesels, I find myself going back to basics here.  With more expensive fuel costs, diesels represented the long-standing ONLY alternative.  Obviously there were no hybrids all those years. So, let's cross the Atlantic and come back to the good 'ol USA, and recognize that for the most part during our history, fuel has been cheap enough to go through the years of muscle cars and giant SUV's.  But now, there is change in the wind, and with the new generation of diesels that will be offered over the next years, I think we will see diesels slowly take a foothold for the first time in our history that could be considered significant.Yes, I agree with you about the logical extension of hybrid technology and it will be marketed successfully.  But I also now am witnessing an interesting polarization of the hybrid.  In other words, I think the hybrid will do very well at the economical end of the spectrum, where it actually financially pays for itself in real monetary terms, such as the Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid, and the upcoming Honda Fit . . . AND hybrid technology will probably do well in the upper end, such as with the upcoming Lexus LS600h.  This polarization that I am predicting will leave the middle ground open for more efficient ICE engines and DIESELS, IMO.  Additionally, diesels can gain ground in the economical end of the spectrum, alongside the hybrids, AND the upper end of the spectrum, in the HELMS.  I have a firm belief, especially when I consider some of the passionate posts on this and the LPS forums, that MANY folks would just LOVE to have a terrific car with a terrific diesel as its powerplant.One hour ago, I heard on the news that gasoline will rise at least 25 cents per gallon this summer.  This will flirt with the $3 + per gallon area again . . . and that seems to be the trigger point for folks to start complaining and looking for alternatives.  And it will get worse, given the international political and business structure at this point in time.  (The China factor, the Iran factor, etc.)Anyway, I am not as pessimistic about diesel's potential in the marketplace as you seem to be.  I am more optimistic and think that both hybrids and diesels will make progress.  It will be interesting indeed.  TagMan"
"I sure hope GS and IS sales numbers will become a significant contributor to Lexus sales overall. Even at half the volume of LexusES or RX (each close to 100k vehicles, give or take 20k), that will be like another 100k vehicles per year. 300k vehicles a year would be enough to overtake BMW global sales with sales in the US alone! Unfortunately, the GS production line is not much greater than current lsvolume (about 20-30k a year), and IS is only set around 50k units per year. Lots of doubletalk here, really don't understand any of it ..especially about Lexus overtaking BMW in sales worldwide with on volume in the U.S. alone?  What the hell?  Makes no sense at all. The 1gen IS300 was never targetted to overtake 3Series in sales volume; the production line was only 20k units per year, 1/3 of 3Series sales volume in the US alone. IS300 sold every car there was in the first couple years without heavy discounting. In fact, you could not get close to invoice like normal discounting until the 3-4th year. The car never had $10k+ discounts even to the end like MB is doing on many of its models Saying they sold every unit doesn't mean anything when they didn't bring over that many in the first place!  It like saying productin is sold out when production is low to begin with.  No matter how you spin it the car flopped big time.  Period.  The car never had 10K discounts because a car in the 30-35K segement doesn't typcially have an extra 10K than can be take off to sell it.  Very disingenuous remark.   As to the argument that lssells more due to lower pricing, well, lump-sum $50-70k is actually much more expensive than $450/mo in cash-flow equivalence analysis, assuming disinterested bank rates and normal depreciation. It actualy would not surprise me if MB decide to bring the S350 over in the next generation; if it can make money at $450/mo with it, there will be buyer/leasers. 265hp is plenty enough for a car like that, for chauffer purpose and short business runs in town. The question is whether it can actually make money at that price point. Thank you for at least being consistent in your thinking and irrelevancy about everyone leasing. M"
"I wonder when the major North American rags will make their first comparisons.I'd say in either their November or December issues. I've seen it before where Lexus ""asks"" for these comparos whenever a new lsis introduced.  Car and Driver of course will be first.  The LS460L, SClass, 750Li, A8L, and XJL will be the contestants.  The Phaeton won't be asked back due to its pending death in our market and the Quattroporte is a different breed of car. M"
"I wonder why most magazines that like softer riding cars like theSClass, LexusLS, and XJ almost always complain about the 7Series Sport's ride? The car is set up as a sporty sedan in its segment, more so than any non AMG S, A8 or non ""R"" XJ. The upcoming S8 will soon join the upcoming S63 as the sporty (if not outright sports sedans) in this class. Claiming what buyers buy these cars for don't change what they are.And how many S8 or S63 sales would be made again ????Lexus being more prestigious than Mercedes and BMW. Is this supposed to be funny? A company that doesn't even control their own home market ain't got no prestige over Europe's ruling luxury car markers - Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Let's face it, MBs and BMWs derive a huge chunk of their Euro sales from low end 3 and C-class cars that are mostly used as sherpas.... taxi cabs, I mean.. These cars litter the streets of Europe - vinyl seats, no A/C, manual windows, steel wheel covers, pretty much bare-bones... All of which counts towards MB and BMWs *prestige*, eh ? Oh, but here in NA, they market them exclusively as luxury brands... Good marketing that's all...Yes, MB and BMW are pretigious brands, no doubt, but to make them into these super brands is a myth, especially these days. Notice how the new GS is priced close to the comparable MBs and BMWs. How about the new IS and its MB and BMW competition... practically about same. Does that tell you something ???Lexus didn't even become ""Lexus"" in their own country of origin until this year, yet they're supposed to have some type of prestige over Mercedes and BMW.The kinda of sentiment MB had back in 1989. Continue the sarcasm..."
"I'm not saying that all non Lexus vehicles are shop hogs. The cars that compete specifically with the lsthough, particularly the 7 and A8, are not exactly known for setting the world on fire when it comes to reliability.OK . . . a moment between football games . . .Looks like Len and I are happy campers so far with the Steelers big win.  But, I'm looking for Seattle to win the next one, which puts me out on a limb a little, but that's OK.In the bigger picture, I'm sorry that I haven't considered that the A8 is that significant a competitor to the Lexus LexusLS."
"I'm not trying to sound superior. My point is to point out the fundamental difference in mind set/priorities between the German/Japanese customer. I think Hpowers said it best when he pointed it out that Cyclone4 didn't even mention performance. If it helps, I do think that Lexus is more sophisticated a car than Buick but, FWIW I never mentioned Buick, That was the good Mr.Tagman. Again FWIW for me reliablility would comes as a lower priority than performance. Something that Lexus does well. I can live with some glitches to have a car drive a certain way that I feel appropriate. This is what many have been saying all along.  All you have to do is read the postings on various Germancar boards vs. Lexus and you'll see a clear difference, especially when talking about the LS/SC/ES. Now the GS and IS are somewhat different, especially the IS.  Perfomance never, ever comes up and when it does and the Germancar outperforms the Lexus, you'll get the it doesn't matter response because this is America and you can only drive 55/65/75 mph anyway.

"I'm sorry, I'm still having trouble figuring out why I would need the LWB version of the LexusLS. To me, it is only relevant to the chauffeur-driven executive. As it is now, the back seat of the lshas plenty of leg room for normal adults. Heck, this is why I wanted out of myEClass.  Who the heck are you carrying in back that needs to have a leg rest, etc.? I love my kids and my business partners, but not enough to treat them like potentates. Some upscale real estate agents have the 750Li and specifically want the L so their clients have extra room in the backseat.  Business executives that are always entertaining clients are common owners....It might sound crazy to you, but if you've ever ridden in the back of an ""i"" vs an ""Li"", you'd be impressed with the comfort.  In addition to that, you can only get the articulated and ventilated seats with the Li.When you're talking $80k, what's an extra $4k?"
"I've never ever read(and I read a lot) anything out of Germany that'll suggest a lsto be more reliable than a MB. That's not Germany's MO. Most rags there don't mention car and lsin the same sentence.Typical sentiment from a Germancarfan dissing Lexus, and the LexusLS. Read that article syswei linked yet ? Maybe you'd not like this 2004 survey in this link as well, from Germany's Autobild magazine. Notice where MB, Audi and BMW are ranked in their own home country versus Toyota ? Or how about this one link which puts your fav Audi in a lot of positive spins, but you gather reading b/w the lines that Toyota will only gain strength in Europe especially when (not if) quality/reliability starts to dominate over engineering and beauty of the German cars..."
"If not, why does the 6 cyl E350 sell so well vs. the 8 cyl E500? When I bought my E320 in 1998, I was fully satisfied with its 6.9 sec 0-60 vs. 6.4 for the E430. I would imagine a lot of people are making the same valuation now, with an $8350 MSRP price differential between the starting prices of the current models (yes, some of which is due to other options included on the E500). Well thats a different class and the E350 is more competitive with other cars in that class compared to what a 335hp S450 would be compared to the 7SeriesL, 07' LS460 and A8L.  Plus the E's market segment is dominated by six cylinder engines which typcially aren't known for big hp numbers anyway.  I just think they'd be better off at least making the S450 look more competitive on paper with more hp for it. MB will bring in the S450 as soon as it has excess production capacity over the demand for the more-profitable SClass. When that will be is beyond my ken. They're just not going to say when too early for fear of slowing down  SClass sales. I'll buy that.  I think they may be trying to see where the LS460 will price in addition to what you've stated. M"
"If you could provide a quote linking Lexus and Buick, that would help mount a credible argument Read the C&D comparo between the SC430 and the CLK430 Cabrio in which the SC430 lost, as usual.  That is where I remember the first such reference about a Lexus vehicle.  As is usually the case with lsvs.  SClass comparisons, the big question is value vs. price no object, as MT magazine puts the lsat the top of the class when value/price is factored. No they don't, becauase even then the lslost to the A8 more recently.  Interesting how you disassociate yourself from the more comparableSClass. You seem very eager to put the lsagainst the SClass? Are you admitting the lsis far superior to the embattledSClass? The SClass can't make up a 15HP difference?I haven't disassociated myself from anything, I'm just pointing out to you that this about the ""S-Class"" losing to the LexusLS isn't correct because it is only the SClass that has ever lost to the LexusLS, not the ""S-Class"" as a whole.  You seem eager to ignore any tests that put the LexusLS in any other spot than #1.  M"
"I wonder if the Crown Majesta should have been the GS. It would have done more damage to anEClass than current GS will do to a 5Series IMO.I have to agree with you here, Len.  The relationship between the LexusES and the GS300 has always been confusing to me, even understanding the large technical differences between them.For example, in about a year I will be looking for a replacement for my '98 E320 (extremely low mileage) that my wife is now driving, and I can't figure out what to get for her.  She's no sports car driver, but unless an AWD version of the LexusES becomes available, I'm not sure I'd want to see her in a FWD car.  And the GS300AWD is too small in the back seat to be practical, but the lsis more car than she wants.  She's not going to like the interior of the 5Series, and neither of us can stand to look at the nose of the A6.  And I'm not ready to assume that MB has fixed the reliability problems of the E yet, although perhaps by then I will be - but I think a new version will be coming out around then, and that really makes me nervous!  All of which leads me to believe that if the Majestic has a better back seat than the GS (the pics make it look like it does), it might be the answer for her.Of course, the best answer may be to convince her to take my LexusLS, and then I can justify getting the new one!  :shades: Bottom line questions for lexusguy:  wouldn't it be nice to have a ""baby LS"" in the showroom, rather than just a gussied-up Camry and 2 versions of an poorly-sized sport sedan?  Would the Majesta fill that role?"
"IMO, either the  SClass or LS460L depending on how the price factor plays out.Yeah, it will really depend on how much weight C&D decides to put on the Lexus' price advantage. I can see it going either way. The XJ has already managed to beat the A8 and 7 in their last comparison, so it will probably be 3rd, with the 750 in 4th, and the A8 bringing up the rear."
"In the >90K price range, the number of MB car sales are so small as to be insignificant. The price range that counts is the $50 - $80K. That is the sweet spot in the market we are talking about here, and that is where Lexus outshines the others, as the market has spoken.  That maybe the case with the ""others"" but it certainly isn't the case when it comes to Mercedes-Benz. At the  50-80K ""sweet spot"" price point, that statement is incorrect if you're referring to Mercedes.  Since 2005 isn't over yet, let&#146;s look at 2004. Mercedes has roughly 4 models that sell in your noted price range of 50-80K, the G, E, CLK and most of theSClass. Now between the E, S, CLK, and G-Class Mercedes sold 103,461 cars that cost roughly between 50-80K in 2004.  Those numbers don't even reflect the CL, SClass and SLR at 2683, 12,885 and 45 units respectively, all of which sell at prices way above any Lexus.  In the >90K price range, the number of MB car sales are so small as to be insignificant.  Sorry, but just because Lexus doesn't sell anything past 70K doesn't mean the 12K+ SL's Mercedes sold last year at 90K+  are ""insignificant"". Such a statement can't be taken seriously as no one else even comes close to such volume at that price point. Why is it that if Lexus doesn't do it, it is deemed insignificant?  Anyway, back to your original statement about the 50-80K price bracket.  Lexus has the LexusLS, GS430, LX470 and SC430 that sell between the 50-80K price points you mentioned. I couldn't find the total number for 2004 for the SC430, but the GS, LexusLS, and LX sold 50,380 units. This is counting the GS as a whole because if you look at the just the GS430, which is the only 50K GS model the 8,262 units the ""GS"" sold last year would be a whole lot less. A whole lot less considering hardly nobody bought a GS430 last year.  (Even with the new car the GS300 is by far the majority of GS sales, but thats another story.)    Even if you add the 35,420 units the GX470 sold last year and add say 12K SC430 sales last year (which I don't think it sold that many), you still get 97,880 units which is still below the Mercedes total. The SC430 number is very generous imo as I seriously doubt it sold that many in 2004.   If you take away the GS300, you'd most likely wind up with about 90K units for Lexus sold in that 50-80K price (which is very impressive I'll admit) range compared to roughly over 100K units for Mercedes. Now if you have differing numbers I'd like to be corrected here, especially about the SC430 which I admit I'm guessing since I couldn't find a grand total for 2004 anywhere.   Except for a huge number of SC430 sales way over what I gave, switching the price bracket doesn't change anything.  Plus you're ignoring the extra 15,613 units Mercedes sold over your 80K price bracket. Either way you want to chop it, Mercedes is still the #1 choice for the mainstream, high-end luxury car buyer.   The world of Bentley, Aston-Martin, Rolls-Royce and Maybach is quite different. M"
"In the case of MB you are rewarding them for tremendous inefficiencies in their production process and bad cost controls overall. They have to get those prices because they'd be bleeding to death without them. In CFO land this is the ultimate no-no. On the other hand you are penalizing a brand that is lean and mean and can price aggressively. In CFO land this is another major no-no. All things being relative MB has had to substantially reduce its mark-up over its costs to produce its cars in the last 15 years. All very nice and what not, but largely irrelevant to this discussion.  No one cares as to why a car is priced the way it is, nor do I dispute what you're saying about MB's fixed costs.  Everyone knows that Germany is the most expensive place in the world to build a car and add that that a non-Toyota-like way of building them and poof(!) here come your huge sticker prices.  You're right, but that isn't the focus of this discussion at the moment.  We were debating who is a HELM and who isn't.  But all things are not equal and you cannot penalize anyone that has big cost efficiencies and a big build cost advantage because they are using that as an advantage in price. IMO a HELM is a market perception issue and a lux feature issue. Sure I can because cost isn't the only issue here.  Lexus is synthetic, it is a name plucked out of thin air during a 1987 Toyota board meeting.  It lacks the sense of occasion, the heritage, there is no sizzle to the nameplate, nothing to read about pre-1989. I can see the issue dr. fill raises clearly because in the US Audi lacks the first one but has all, and then some of the second one. I certainly consider Audi a HELM - I just don't think they will ever make it big here. It's not going to be overcome by marketing either. It's an image problem and it will take a phenomenal US investment to overcome.I see the issue and the point that he is making, but my point wasn't that Audi is above Lexus, it was that neither Audi or Lexus is on the same, equal level as Mercedes and BMW.  I agree it would take a miracle in today's market to get Audi to the volumes and presence that other HELM's enjoy, but anything is possible.  In 1992 they were at 12K units a year and really on the brink of leaving the U.S. market, despite what Audi management said at the time, they were.  This whole status thing with Lexus changes by the hour.  One minute we're told the Lexus equals MB/BMW and yet in the next we're told that MB/BMW's higher status helps them sells more cars at the top end.  I mean it can't be both.  Either Lexus is equal to Mercedes/BMW in the prestige/status game or they aren't.  At 17 years of age and only one true high-end vehicle I say they aren't even close in overall position, but they are still highly regarded for sure.   VW doesn't have the pockets to make such a major distribution investment and the competition is way too fierce. To see that latter point just look at Lexus vs VW in sales. Lexus outsells or nearly outsells the cheap brand and before too much longer will outsell VW and Audi combined. It's also why the Phaeton was such a waste. That money should have been put into Audi for a greater UD dealer network and a much better looking dealer network. All the marketing in the world is worthless without a foundation investment and Audi lacks foundation in much of the US. Hence it's perception will always be lacking. Much of it's sales is highly regionalized to the northeast and over time more and more AWD offerings from the big three in the group will cut into that market share. Again I agree with most of this, but the reason I brought up VW was because of the instance by OAC that a HELM is sedan not a ""marque"" as the thread header says.  If we're going by what a sedan costs and the category then that puts VW in, though we all know that the VW brand isnt' a HELM. This inclusion of a brand based on one car was the flaw in that theory. That is what I was pointing out to Oac.  Again, I agree with much of what you've said here. I've never had a handling problem with the lsand despite all the MB handling comments on the board over the years I find that there is virtually no difference between an SClass and an lsin handling and agree with syswei that the S has gravitated more and nore toward the lsin the last few years. Impossible because if that were the case the S would have worse handling and the car has only gotten better in handling especially since the 2000 model vs the old tank 1992SClass.  All cars have gotten quieter and more refined over the years, its called progress.  There is no way the S has move in Lexus' direction while all the time the lswas becoming basically a copy of theSClass' design with the LexusLS. When you ape an entire bodystyle that is more than ""moving in a direction"" of your competitor.  The SClass always put luxury first even back in the day when it was only an SClass and a 7Series so saying the S has moved closer to the wannabe S, when the wannabe lsgot it's mojo from the S in the first place doesn't make sense to me.

"If you look at my original post, I never claimed that Lexus has out-innovated MB specifically in SAFETY since 1990. I did claim that, since 1990, Toyota/Lexus innovations IN TOTAL are at least as significant to the industry as MB innovations.Really? Would you please provide a list of Toyota/Lexus innovations, in total, since 1990 that make them ""at least as significant"" to MB innovations? For all of MB&#146;s 120 years of safety innovations, does the SClass actually end up safer than the 15-year-young LS? Actually, not according to real-world data. Check the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website...you&#146;ll find that the lshas 16% LESS personal injury losses than the S (46 vs 55 based on 100 equaling average injury losses?both are very safe, but the lsis clearly SAFER).Wow, this is probably the most inaccurate and misleading post I have read in a long time. First of all, you can't compare numbers for cars in different classes. Notice how the SClass is rated as a ""very large"" car and the lsis a ""large"" car. Secondly, the injury loss rate is of little to no value when determining the overall safety of a car, ESPECIALLY when the numbers are so close as is this case.  Driver demographics, location demographics and a certain degree of randomness all affect these numbers. For example, I think it would be fair to assume that the lsis more likely to be driven by older, more experienced drivers. The S on the other hand, has greater appeal to hotshot young males with money, who like to drive fast and recklessly. Who would you expect to drive into a tree more often and with greater force?And you still haven't been able to explain away the following, since Lexus is such a safety conscious brand and all:-Lexus doesn't offer rear side airbags on ANY of its vehicles. (Standard across MB line)-Lexus doesn't offer rollover protection on its SC430 convertible. (Standard on the SClass since 1989)-Lexus doesn't offer rear head airbags on the IS or GS. (Standard across entire MB line)-Lexus doesn't offer head protection airbags on its SC430 convertible. (SL does)-Lexus doesn't offer standard ESC on its IS300 (Standard across entire MB line since 1999).-Lexus doesn't off rear seatbelt ETDs or load limiters, except on the lsand LexusES. (Standard across entire MB line).-Lexus doesn't offer emergency telematics on any vehicle. (Available across entire MB)-Lexus doesn't offer battery disconnect/fuel shutoff. (Standard across entire BMW line).These are just a few of the safety features that Lexus lacks in comparison to MB vehicles. Not to mention the fact that the safety features that Lexus does have, were all introduced several years after MB. I have to disagree here. You seem to take fatalities as the measure of a carmaker&#146;s worth to the world. What about fatalities due to pollution? Do you recognize that hybrid power trains, once more widely adopted (including by the Germans, once they &#147;copy&#148; the technology), will save many lives due to fuel savings and hence lower emissions? Well, I guess if a 56% reduction in single vehicle fatalities due ONE of Mercedes' countless innovations isn't impressive to you, I don't know what would be. I can't discredit Toyota/Lexus for their work with hybrid technology, but this technology is still in its infancy and isn&#146;t even an economically sound alternative to regular fuel engines. I&#146;m not sure that hybrid technology really qualifies as a &#147;safety feature&#148; more like an environmental feature. When the IIHS issues a report that hybrid technology accounts for a 56% reduction in fatalities, let me know. MB's U.S. product line actually starts LOWER in price than does Lexus'. If you eliminate all of MB's models at price points higher than Lexus' highest price point, Lexus still outsells MB in the U.S., only by a wider margin. MB product is available in the entire Lexus price range, and then some. Why can't MB outsell Lexus if price is the barrier? I&#146;m not sure where you got your numbers from, but all I had to do was visit the Lexus and MB website to disprove this theory. Here are the following BASE prices for competing Lexus and MB cars:S430: $77,970LS430: $56,225SL500: $92,020SC430: $63,575E350: $50,770GS300: $38,875ML350: $38,670 RX : $36,025C230: $29,970IS300: $30,280With the exception of the IS, every Lexus vehicle is significantly less expensive than base Mercedes vehicles with no options.  As soon as you upgrade the engine or add some options, the price difference soars exponentially. So essentially, yes there is a price barrier? a HUGE price barrier.Some value needs to be accorded MB's higher prestige. If a Timex watch were physically IDENTICAL to a Rolex, except for the brand name, don't you think Rolex could still price somewhat higher, but sell the same number of units as the physically same but lower-prestige Timex? No I don&#146;t. First of all, Timex watches and Rolex watches aren&#146;t identical, much the same as MB and Lexus aren&#146;t identical. Second of all, even if Rolex did price its watches &#147;somewhat&#148; higher than a Timex, it still wouldn&#146;t sell as many as the lower priced Timex. The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product, as is the case for watches or cars. I&#146;ve already shown you that MB vehicles are much more expensive than Lexus, so this effect is only magnified. Since MB has more ""content"" in the form of prestige, it follows that consumers should be willing to pay a little more but still buy it in the same numbers as Lexus. But they don't. Again, consumers aren&#146;t paying &#147;a little more&#148; they are paying on the order of 10k-30k more for BASE MB models compared to loaded Lexus models. Adding options and engines to MB models only exacerbates this difference."
"Infiniti has not quite mastered the art of leveraging its plebian product into something ""desirable"" at significantly high price point, perhaps due to lack of execution in details. What plebeian product does Infiniti have left? The G20, I35, and QX4 are all dead. I think the biggest problem with all of those cars is they were transparent rebadges of Nissan products, with essentially zero justifaction for big price increases other than slightly different body work. Infiniti never learned how to do products like the LexusES and TL, or RX and MDX. The QX56 shows that they still don't understand that you need more than a wood steering wheel to make a ""luxury version"" of one of your regular products."
"INHO there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" when it comes to the ideal tradeoff between sport and luxury.I totally agree and would never argue that point. But the basis of my contention goes back to Oac saying? ?I'd argue that the word *sport* and the cars we debate on this forum - S, 7, A8 and ls- do not belong.And the ultimate dis by Lexusguy?Compared to the Maser's Ferrari V8 and F1 gearbox, the BMW is hardly an ""ultimate"" anything.?because if I recall correctly, the reviews of the Quattroporte&#146;s handling weren&#146;t exactly glowing, plus the high revving engine and sequential gearbox in that thing don&#146;t even belong on street cars in my opinion. BMW and Mercedes have the best formula for real-world engines.BMW doesn&#146;t claim to be the ultimate LUXURY car, just the ultimate DRIVING machine with regard to SEDANS (it also applies to the SUVs), which is an accolade created not by themselves, rather by their buyers long ago. And compared with most of the real-world sedans in production, it is right on the money."
"Interesting !!!! lsneeds a low price as its saving grace ? This is a new one. How many times are we going to repeat ourselves when it comes to pricing. TPS is an efficient system, so efficient that Lexus/Toyota can produce their cars at lower costs relative to the over-priced German labor market. Do you not see how labor costs, supplier costs, and production efficiency play significant roles in car pricing ? Excuse moi.... I am not gonna overpay for a German car when a comparable version from Japan is cheaper and more durable (read: reliable). And since I don't live in my car, the few times I need to drive it, I enjoy driving regardless if its in luxury or sport mode... That is a good question!  How many times are we going to hear this about TPS and why an SClass costs more than a LS?  For the jillionith time, no Germancarfan here is saying that this isn't the case, but a buyer couldn't care less about any of this.  All they see is the sticker price. The bottom line is that the lshas been cheaper than all of its European rivals, especially Mercedes which typcially is the priciest of the entries in the segment.  That cheaper price, regardless as to how it came to be, is a factor in the LexusLS and previous lsmodels selling so well compared to much pricier German iron. Right here on this very board you've touted how the LS460 is starting atEClass/5Series prices, yet you'll tout that the lsis likely to become the best selling car in it's ""class"" when the average price for one isn't really even in the same ""class"" as the car it mostly competes with!  Nothing in the entire bag of Lexus rhetoric could be more hypocritical, two-faced, fallacious, specious and downright disingenuous.  It runs the gamut. M"
"is this a ""Luxury Brand""....rebadged Toyota's????  ?Less than Audi being rebadged VW.  At least the RWD system in lsis not found in any Toyota sold in the US (in Japan, all Lexus models are sold as Toyotas untill this year), whereas the AWD system in A8 is found in numerous lesser Audis and VW's. ?Considering that the most expensive convertibles from Audi share platforms with Golf (TT) and Passat (A4), and a reskinned Golf econobox (A3) is coming to the US soon to compete with the lowest Acura (RSX), there is precious little luxury marquee value left in Audi.   MB has been coming down the same route with the C and A class crap cars, which now account for more than half of all MB's sold in Europe.  Makes you wonder if the Germans are considering retaining only RR, Maybach and Bentley as ""high end luxury marques.""  Perhaps the main-stream German brands, like VW, BMW and MB, will soon compete at Toyota brand level, which is actually moving up-market and leaving Scion to deal with the likes of Smart and Mini."
"Infiniti is a successful flagship away from being on the same level as Lexus. I'm not sure about that.  Infiniti still isn't a full lineup provider on the level of Lexus.  They don't have a convertible and it appears that they aren't getting the GTR either. Infiniti' SUV lineup also pales next to Lexus' though I'd take a FX over a RX anyday.  The QX like you stated has hit the skids in several areas while the Lexus LX (though outdated) is pretty much an icon compared to the QX. With the 07' lsLexus has built up too great of a lead over Infiniti in that area for Infiniti to catch up now.  I'm starting to see some hairline cracks in the whole Nissan/Infiniti comeback.  Lexus is also set to introduce that LF-A sports car while Nissan dealers get the car that Infiniti should be getting as their respose, the GTR. I still think Infiniti are more desireable than Lexuses in nearly every class, but as far as clout/status/prestige etc they have a good ways to go before matching Lexus IMO. M"
"Jealousy. No. Disappointment. Yes.If jealousy is not there, then why all the negative press from the Euro club here ? To get away from it the Euro fans even created their own forum which ended up dead without the LexusLS! Yes, there are many very jealous of an upstart Lexus who have made it all the way up there in a very short time. That the lsis the #1 luxury sedan in the NA market hurts as well... The fact that the new lswill pose a serious challenge to the new SClass, is a tell-tale sign that many MB fans are nervous of the new LexusLS. I am sure MB execs are nervous as well... The list of buyers for the new lsgrows daily, and the new S cannot sustain its torrid sales pace, especially when the new lsgets here.Disappointment ? In what ? remember we are talking HELMs here..."
"Just think what you are saying. MB the leader, the innovator, the true HELM is holding back trying to see what Lexus the copycat, the pretender, the updated Buick-maker, is going to do? Wow, merc, you really have come a long way in the last year towards looking at things from a wider perspective. I salute you! LOL....picture me grudingly typing this like a stubborn little kid, saying ""thank you"".  Seriously though MB isn't above having to re-think things from time to time especially with pricing in this segment.  I don't think anyone MB/BMW/Audi/Jaguar etc. thought Lexus would add nearly 100hp to the lsthis time around. M"
"KBB, ALG and the Blue Book:  What further stats do you fellows need to understand that BMW is number one in residual values? Well, let's start with the fact that ""KBB"" and ""Blue Book"" are the same - what do you think the BB stands for?But I'll try one more time.  Let's start with the assumption that the car you drive - a 3Series - is a great car; most would even say the best in its class.  It probably has excellent residuals, and in terms of units sold, could certainly put BMW's ""average"" residuals way up there.But if you are buying a car in the group covered on this forum, the 3's residual is irrelevant.  The only BMW model that is relevant here is the 7Series.So even though it should be blatantly obvious to everyone that historical data shows the LS' residuals are better than the 7's, let's do this one more time based on Edmunds data, which is supposedly based on ALG data on projected residuals (see the 2/12/04 press release on ALG's web site that announces it is providing info to Edmunds).Edmunds.com has a section called Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  They do exactly what we all agree is the correct way to determine residual value (although they do it using ALG's 5 year projected depreciation, rather than historical data).  They use current TMV (True Market Value) for purchase price, and the projected private party sales price for disposition price, with the difference being depreciation.So using the Edmunds/ALG TCO data, a 745 can be bought for $77,409 and is projected to depreciate $44,257 over 5 years, therefore retaining 42.8% of original cost.  An lscan be bought for $61,698 and is projected to depreciate $34,501 over the next 5 years, for a 44.1% retained residual.I think I have now shown conclusively that both on historical and projected data, the lshas better residuals than the 745.  But some folks here won't accept it anyway. There certainly may be reasons to prefer the 745 over the LexusLS, but residual value is not one of them.Oh, by the way, TCO for the 745 is $1.11 per mile vs. $.96 for the LexusLS.  And for those who are interested, it's $1.15 for the MBSClass, $1.22 for the 4matic version.  The Audi A8 and Phaeton both run $1.12; the Jag XJL is $1.01.If nothing else, we should all be able to agree that the lsis the value leader in this class, both up front and long term."
"Let's ask this again: What exactly do you guys constantly harp on as ""performance"" ? is this about suspension setup, steering and/or road feedback, speed, or what ?? You also add ""handling""... Is the MB better at handling than an ls? And sayz who ? Is the MB a better performance car than the ls? Sayz who. The last comparo of record was the MT Dec 2003 report for MY2004 releases. The LexusLS won that comparo, while the SClass came dead last... or close to last. And pls note that the S didn't come last despite its better performance against the LexusLS.... If you have to ask OAC then I really don't think you'll get it. Seriously.  The LexusLS I drove keeled over at the mere thought having to corner or change directions on the course that LEXUS provided.  Granted that previous  SClass was no BMW 7Series, but the car remained flatter, the steering has more feel and a Benz has always felt rock-steady at speed. These are things that Lexus doesn't seem to want to do with all the of the lsmodels up to this point. The seats in a Mercedes are more supportive, the LexusLS seats in particular are appallingly flat and church-benchish. Its all that about the steering, brakes, seats, stability in a car like the LexusLS vs. theSClass, A8 or 7Series that germancarfans talk about here.  Ask the ones that have recently bought an SClass or A8, Tony and Sam, they'll tell you exactly what I'm saying having owned both cars. Performance  isn't just a straight line which is what I think a lot of Lexus fans seem to think here with all the constantly rattling off of 0-60 times, especially since they aren't going to drive like that anyway, its silly really.  Performance is the whole package, something Mercedes admittedly doesn't do as good as BMW, but does better than Lexus. I guess its easy to always throw the ""performance"" and ""handling"" shpeel out there as things German cars are always better than Japanese cars... It's simply become an acceptable fact to be announced everytime whether its actually true or not.It is, but you wouldn't see it that way because how a car stops, steers etc. is seemingly lost here if the numbers don't put the German car ahead of the Lexus.  Just because a car might put up better numbers in certain tests (especially handling) does not mean that the car feels natural doing those things.  Neither a Lexus or a Mercedes is a BMW, but a MB is closer than a Lexus is when it comes to the SClass and the LexusLS.  No one saying the SClass is a sport sedan. Note: There was a time when Cadillac had tuned and worked on the previous fwd Seville to death, getting it to the point where it could outhandle aEClass or A6 and could hang with a 5Series through a slalom, but in the process it would shave all the tread off of its tires and the body control was gawd-awful.  Numbers only tell part of the story. I have yet to read of an lsthat tipped over taking a corner way too fast bcos its handling was terrible. Ok, you've lost the plot with that one.  Modern cars don't ""tip over"" unless you've done something terribly wrong, especially a German car or any other car of this class.  I said the LexusLS I drove at the Taste of Lexus felt  like it would tip over, not that I could get it do that on that course, but that feeling doesn't lend any substance to the lsbeing on equal dynamic footing as the Germans in this class.  It isn't. Does the ls's 278HP not best theSClass's 275HP ? Always.... Put a Z-rated shoe on the lswith the Euro suspension, and pit it against an S with dynamic suspension and the crap on it, and let's see which car outshines the other.Old news and to add insult to injury Lexus dealers know their customers don't care about handling because a LexusLS with the so-called ""Euro"" package can't even be found. Talk about an answer to a question no one is asking!  Until Lexus can produce the car you'll never know, but there is nothing to indicate the Lexus would win over a ABC equippedSClass, anyway this is all old-news and we'll have to see who the new S and lsstack up. Hmmmm ! The likes of JDP, CR, etc are mere nuisance in the industry then, eh ? If buyers and auto execs don't care about what these companies provide, why do they even exist ??? They must not serve any need in the business, right? I'll let you answer that one.... For the indusrty of course they matter, but again you missed the point.  My point is that obviously it isn't the holy grail like Lexusfans make it out to be otherwise no other brand would be able increase sales or get a new product off the ground with such a bad rep.  The previous SClass was trashed soundly in these same surveys for years, yet the new one is selling like hotcakes, obvously not every cares about and worships CR/JDP resports like Toyota/Lexus fans do.  Range Rover and VW buyers really couldn't care any less. M"
"It is easy to over-rate one specific product of a company and glamorize that one achivement to the rest of the products offered by that same companyI take it then that you are suggesting that the lsis the only true success for Lexus?  Because I don't see it that way. I see the current IS as a hit in addition to the LexusLS.  I see huge SUV sales that must have been hurting SOMEONE. The LexusES is no slouch.  The SCand GS are a concern, but the SCwill get replaced, and when it does, who knows?  The GS is still a mystery to me.  I think it can't compete well in that class, with BMW 5 out there.But, all in all, I see more than just an LexusLS, and I STILL think that the newest IS will spawn a new type of small sedan and coupe success for Lexus.I agree the 3Series is awesome, but so is theSClass.  Vulnerable?TagMan"
"Lexus sells over 300k units a year from less than 200 stores, nationwide. And they sold 40k lsin 1992 for over $45k, which with inflation, puts it's price near Audi's A8 today. Numbers of dealers is no excuse. What does this have to do with Audi? Audi isn't run like Lexus (you'll like that comment). Audi struggles with an image problem and for its worth the A8 has sold much better since the 2004 model arrived. Again, this is why I think it is downright careless to point to sales as the final determining factor on how good a car is.  There are many things that go into who sells what and how many. M"
"Lexus has core competence such as RX, LexusES and lsthat account for 70-80% of total sales volume and never need heavy discounting, whereas MB does not have a single model line that can hold its price up through a model run, some heavily discounting shortly after introduction. That is indicative of massive prestige loss . . . in more technical and relevent terms: massive loss of brand equity. This is one is so good I had to reply twice.  This (grand excuse) lets the previous GS and IS off the hook for being sales slackers because they weren't ""core models"".  Also, this seems to imply that every Lexus has held to MSRP throughout its entire production run.  That is plain bs brightness.  Every car on the market goes through the same cycle of being hot and then decline with some discounting at the end of the production run.  Lexus is no different.  The only thing that differs from brand to brand is how the maker controls the supply of model at the end.  Some will try to flood the market with units (even add models like MB did) and others will cut production to keep from having to resort to discounting. Lexus will slow down production or an outgoing model like the LexusLS and then their fans here will act as though they're hot sellers right up until the end, nevermind that they're selling less units, like the LexusLS is this year.

"Lexus simply did not update the two in subsequent years, partly because it focused effort on RX, LexusES and LexusLS,So now you are reaching into the magical Lexus ""bag of excuses"".  How ridiculous can you get?  Let's see now, after my second child was born, I might have used the ""Lexus magic excuse"" and stopped taking care of my first kid for a while, or is it that after a while I can stop taking care of the second kid to focus back on the first?   All of this is absurdity at its best. So . . . you now suggest that Toyota/Lexus can't focus on too many things at once!!I'm not buying any of this baloney.TagMan"
"Maybe you'd like to list all the innovations MB has brought forward since 1989 ? And stack them up against Lexus' in the same period... Let's see who wins... Sure, it will easily be Mercedes-Benz.  Lets see since 1989, Mercedes had done stability control, active roll-over protection (something Lexus has no clue about on a 60K SC430 while a VW Bug has the same feature as a 95K SL550), brake assist, curtain airbags, just to name a few.  The only innovation Lexus has brought to the table is hybrids and that was done on Toyota buyers first to test it out.  Lexus doesn't innovate squat, they wait for Mercedes and all the rest to do it. Pls include well-integrated into the list.Everything I named above has been well integrated and test over and over in the real world and it works, so much so that every other luxury car company around today uses it. Mercedes-Benz the innovator, period.  Lexus don't do squat in that area. Do you recall your post commenting on how many electronic features MB are removing from their newer cars just to reduce the electronic gremlins afflicting them ? And that was only circa 2005, or thereabouts... If you don't recall, I can find it for you.... its right here on this HELM board. Of course there was an article from a MB engineer about this, but again you missed the gist of the story by a country mile.  Mercedes did remove unnecessary electronic functions from their cars, not the entire removal of any one particular system. A lot of pre-determined settings and other things that customers wouldn't understand unless they read the manual were removed. Things dealing with pre-sets for the sunroof and things like needless features in the Comand system. BTW, that is you that doesn't remember what you wrote a while back, not me. Obviously you are wrong here. For starters, the affluent class has EXPANDED globally in recent years. Many more people can now afford to own/lease luxury cars, and you see the evidence all around you, and in luxury sedan sales growth.Obviously you don't know what you're talking about here; this doesn't apply to every single person in the luxury car market. 86K is still 86K and 58K is still 58K. Not everyone leases either.  Secondly, a car like MB with so much more attributes than its competitors should be selling in droves, despite its higher price (heritage, class, features, performance, etc).Well the SClass is, but at 90K a pop it won't and can't last forever, there aren't that many buyers out there at that price point to keep sales at the current level forever.  Again, prestige/status doesn't mean anything if you don't have the money to buy the car that has it. I don't see what is so hard to understand about this.  If price didn't mean anything they why the hell does Lexus consistently low-ball the entire class with the LS?  They do this to add a PRICE ADVANTAGE to their resume. Besides, its not like most SClass buyers pay cash for a $90K product. They mostly lease.Stats please?  Facts, not speculation. What percentage finances the difference or buy with cash vs. leasing?  I don't suppose that if I can pay $900/mth on an ""inferior"" LexusLS, I will be easily scared to pay $1200/mth for a ""superior"" SClass.You would if 900 bucks a month was already a reach, and you have no way of knowing the entire world's financial situation.  Again, not everyone leases. Real-world pricing/leasing knocks your argument down, Merc1. Common sense obliterates yours because you don't seem to be able to either produce the numbers about who leases vs. buys or understand that never every luxury car buyer leases in the first place.  There are folks right here on these boards that will tell you that they buy a car like this and keep them for a long time, these folks don't lease. Finally, MB is priced higher BCOS ............. its cost structure is higher, not bcos the car is better. Yeah sure, that must by why people still pay more for MBs and while Lexus can't even get more than merely competitive in more than 2 segments.  Makes sense.  If Lexus were so much better wouldn't they be the king of every segment they compete in?  Wouldn't the American consumer see this stunning Lexus superiority by now?  Oh, you'll say that they're the best selling luxury brand, while they pedal ES/RX vehicles at price under 50K while the bulk of MB's lineup is price above (sometimes way above) 50K.  Yeah that is an apples to apples comparo. M"
"MB is not as cost efficient as Toyota just as Toyota is not as cost efficient as Hyundai. This is not about cost efficiency but about how highly MB is perceived relative to the lsand the willingness of buyers to pay bigger bucks for an equivalent MB. If buyers are willing to pay bigger bucks for the S why does the lscontinually trounce the S in sales YoY for the last 5 yrs running ? Hmmmm.... could it be bcos they are NOT willing to pay bigger bucks, especially where there is a very comparable or better car in the ls???  I gave you an example of the LC v LX470. Loaded, a 2006 LX470 retails for $70K. A loaded 2006 LC retails for $60K, a $10K difference. Yet, the higher priced LX470 sells more units than the lower priced LC. Meaning: people will pay for quality. There is a real quality difference b/w these two trucks. If theSClass/500 are that much better than the LexusLS, people will gladly pay the higher price, and MB should sell lots more than the cheaper LexusLS. Finally, let's do a comparison: How many variants of MB sedans are there v Lexus models ? How many sales of MB cars/SUVs v Lexus cars/SUVs ? How many MB dealerships v Lexus dealerships ???"
"MB starts at 29,970, Lexus at 30,280. MB's product line BRACKETS Lexus' in price. If Lexus ran 30-70k and MB 50-140k you would have a valid point on price. But MB starts slightly lower.So let me get this straight. You think that because the IS costs $310 more than a C230 that Lexus cars are less expensive overall than MB cars? What about the fact that a base E350 costs nearly $12,000 more than a base GS300?  What about the fact that a base ML350 costs $2645 more than a base  RX ? I don&#146;t know why you even bother to bring the option issue to the table because it just proves my point. Not only are base model MB&#146;s more expensive as a group than base model Lexus, but adding on options to both MB and Lexus only widens the gap! Look how high the gap is already between several loaded Lexus and base MB models:Loaded ls: $66,339BASESClass: $77,970Total Difference: $11,631Loaded GS300: $46,034BASE E350: $50,770Total Difference: $4,736Loaded GS430: $54,724BASE E500:  $58,520Total Difference: $3,796S vs LexusLS. lsis often cross-shopped with the E, not solely with the S. You can find examples on these very boards.The base E500 costs $2295 more than the base LexusLS.  The loaded E500 costs $10,495  more than a loaded LexusLS. How do you explain that?SL500 vs SC430. What about the CLK and SLK?The base CLK500 costs $62,920 and the base SC430 costs $63,575. A loaded CLK500 costs $79,139 and a loaded SC430 costs $65,748. The $600 price difference between the base models is insignificant, but the $15,564 price difference between loaded models is significant. &#147;The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product.&#148; You forgot to add the qualifier &#147;all else being equal&#148;. Because if there is suitably higher content to go along with a higher price, the higher priced product need not sell in lower units.Just because MB model X has more &#147;content&#148; than Lexus model Y doesn&#146;t mean that people will opt to pay more for the MB. Some people may not be able to afford the 16,000 price difference between a loaded CLK500 and SC430. Even though they might rather have the MB, the Lexus is a cheaper alternative.Prestige is valuable, and, other things equal, if one product has more prestige it can command a higher price. PRESTIGE IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER &#147;FEATURE&#148; OF A PRODUCT, such as larger engine, better styling, etc?insomuch as people are willing to pay extra for it.True prestige is valuable. This is partially why MB can sell cars at a higher price than Lexus. MB makes its profits by selling fewer cars for more money. Lexus makes its profits by selling more cars for less money. Which economic strategy is better is irrelevant because we&#146;re only talking about why Lexus sells more cars than MB.Suppose there is a housing developer who is building new homes on a large tract of land. Suppose that he offers only two models, &#147;m4&#148; which has 4000 sq ft on 1 acre, and &#147;m5&#148; which haSClass0 sf on 1.25 acres. You are saying &#147;The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product.&#148;?meaning that it is impossible to sell in the same quantities if one is priced higher. I submit that if m5 is priced only slightly higher than m4, say 5%, then it will not only sell more units (directly opposite what you suggest), but it will probably sell MULTIPLE TIMES as many units as m4. Similarly if the developer tries to price too much for the extra content, say 45%, then m4 will outsell m5 by multiple times. If follows that there is a some price premium between 5% and 45% where the two will sell in EQUAL numbers, DESPITE m5 being priced higher. I don&#146;t know if that premium will be 20% or some other number, but the important point is that if a product has higher content, be it size or prestige, it can outsell even a lower-priced product.I understand your analogy but I don&#146;t believe that it accurately applies to Lexus and MB cars. MB cars don&#146;t just cost &#147;5%&#148; more than Lexus cars. MB frequently costs 10k more than a Lexus and in some instances, MB costs several tens of thousands more than Lexus. The price difference isn&#146;t so small as to invalidate the basic economic principle of the demand curve. So you can&#146;t use price as an excuse for MB&#146;s US sales performance, because there is an offsetting factor at work: prestige.  Prestige is a positive factor in MB sales; however, price is an extremely negative factor for MB sales in relation to Lexus. I have already shown that Lexus vehicles, on average, cost more no matter how you calculate it. Lexus costs more base vs. base and Lexus costs more loaded vs. loaded. Also, I don&#146;t have any numbers in front of me at the moment. But I&#146;m fairly certain that the only reason why Lexus outsells MB in the U.S. is because of the RX300/330."
"Merc says that people are noticing and praising Audi for its interior quality and technology innovations. I'd like to see the sampling of the buying public that agrees with that. Edmunds is a very small, narrow, viewpoint of the whole market. Most of us are car junkies.... The real world buyers are nothing like us... So I suspect Audi's interior quality and technology hasn't helped it much, but with the VW albatross on Audi's neck, little wonder it has had problem gaining traction (no pun intended) here in the NA market. It may well be too late for Audi to gain any respect, unless Lexus stumbles badly, and Acura and Infiniti fall off the face of the earth. Audi, totally overshadowed by its higher brand German counterparts... Well I think all you'd have to do is look on any Audi board here or on Audi forum on the net.  Most people here are indeed average buyers and they aren't car junkies in the least, especially not here.  The new A8 doing way better than the previous car proves that Audi is doing something right, though at a slower pace than MB/BMW/Lexus.  Lexus doesn't have to ""stumble"" for Audi to gain any respect, all Audi has to do is keep building cars like the A8, RS4 (to bolster the performance imagine, something Lexus knows very little about right now) and dealership satisfaction stories are just that, they don't vary from car junkies or brand junkies to the average joe that posts here.  A buyer is either satisfied with the dealer of they aren't, doesn't matter what ""type"" of buyer they are per say. M"

"May be not. It was just a radical suggestion. I think lexus should focus more on high end (LX, LS) and enter the $100K+ heaven and convert more buyers towards sporty IS rather than LexusES, so that in future lexus has more sporty personality than now. Want sporty personality ? Buy a Bimmer, a WRX, an STi, a Porsche, anything except a Lexus... The Lexus formula has worked to perfection on most of their line-ups. Except for a few, all their cars/SUVs have been runaway successes ! How do you go against what made you successful ? That makes no business sense whatsoever... Sorry... The new LexusES will sell briskly, and continue to lead its class in sales. If I had Toyota's midas touch, I'd be long retired and enjoying life somewhere on the Pacific Ocean front condo somewhere, playing golf and generally enjoying life. Toyota is as good as gold these days. They cannot seem to put any foot wrong... Gotta love or hate them ! And when gas goes to $5 a gallon, then what ? A survey showed almost 50% of Americans are interested in replacing their current car with a hybrid. Hmmmm !!! That LS600H will be a winner, I can just see it already. More power, more performance, more fuel efficiency, and more environmentally friendly, at a price many thousands below its competition. What is not to make it succeed ???"
"My 01 Ultra has Curtin side airbags in the back and side airbags in the front.You are mistaken. No Lexus vehicle offers rear side airbags. Side airbags are different than curtain side airbags in that curtains protect the head and side airbags protect the torso. The LexusLS has side curtain airbags for both rows, but it doesn't have rear side airbags. Only the front seats of the LexusLS have side airbags to protect the torso, whereas MB and BMW offer these bags for both the front and back seats across their entire model line. Additionally, MB offers standard seat belt ETDs and force limiters for rear seating positions across the entire model line. Lexus only offers these devices on the LexusES and LexusLS. I am not sure what emergency telematrics is..I have to ask is that the thing where if you get into a crash or your air bag inflates a 911 call goes out automatically with the location of your car...I have that...Plus an Emergency button that I can Push...It all works through the GPS systemI guess I was partially mistaken. After doing more research I see that ""Lexus Link"" is available only on the LexusLS, SC430, LX 470 and GX 470. (MB and BMW offer this service on every model).The Price Barrier is a Testement to Lexus construction Techniques...The fact Mercedes is Overpriced is a Bad thing...for them RIGHT?I'm not sure why the fact that Lexus vehicles are cheaper is ""a testament to lexus construction techniques""; more like a testament to pricing strategy and fewer available options. The fact that MB costs more than Lexus is indeed a bad thing for them because they sell fewer cars. WHAT IS THIS INNOVATION..That results in 56% lower fatalities?.. Whatever it is I am sure My Lexus has it....Is it Airbags, Seatbelts, Crumple zones, VSC, ABS, ?...What pray tell are you talking about? I mentioned that ESC (Electronic Stability Control) was a feature that MB pioneerd in 1995, that has resulted in 56% lower single vehicle fatalities and a 41% decrease in all single vehicle crashes. Both MB and BMW had this system in 1995. It took Lexus until 1999 to incorporate this system on the LexusLS, and even today you still can't get it on the IS300."

Far more successful lines than BMW. It may hurt your Germancarfan pride to see how Lexus continues to cream most BMW in sales, must be that most buyers prefer Lexus to BMW, isn't it ? Maybe those buyers don't know/care squat about the drivability of a BMW, eh ? See more of the same. Dewey said nothing of the sort about Lexus cars having to be like BMWs.  The line of discussion was about Lexus being a threat to BMW in the context of getting more die-hard/long time BMW drivers into a Lexus, not the usual cheerleading about sales and who is going to destroy who.  What Dewey is saying is that BMW and Lexus are different types of cars and that neither would gain anything by moving too far in the other's direction.  This has nothing to do with sales, it has to do with what Lexus and BMW think a luxury car should be in terms of design/dynamics etc and how different those views are. M"
"My point was that many people in my circle do NOT want an MB, and it no longer holds the mystique it once held, at least for people I know. ANd the sales factoids backed up that assertion, hence I quoted these for you, just in case you don't believe me. It is crystal clear that less people buy MBs today than they buy the competition, especially Lexus. Yet you continually do not want to connect the dots between MB's downward sales trend relative to its competition (esp. Lexus) and its fall from grace showing it is NO longer the *must have* car for the high-end lux buyer. Bingo!  That is your circle, but the sales numbers still say that MB is the #1 choice for the high-end buyer any way you want to slice it.  Whether or not you agree with it or not, whether or not it is deserved or not, it is what it is.    It the same thing about my circle when I said most people I know see Lexus (except the RX) as being an old man's car, but actual proof was given showing that overall Lexus buyers are younger and MB's.    My perception of the brand didn't equal the reality.  Same thing with your statement about MB and high-end buyers.  You stated that 50-80K is the proper price range and that is where MB rules and the numbers I gave earlier prove it.   That doesn't even include the SL, CL, SLR and various high-end AMG products.  You can't make the judgement about MB not being #1 in status or high-end sales if you're only going to look at some of what they sell.   When Lexus comes out with similar high-end versions of the next LexusLS, and that sports car you'll all of a see what I'm talking about.   All of a sudden the price range that matters will become wherever Lexus tops out at, be it 100K or whatever.  Or, put it this way...if Lexus comes out with a 85-90K version of the next lsit outsells the 750Li and  SClass that won't matter because its over 80K?  Or will you then stretch the price bracket to include that Lexus? Look at it objectively. How can MB be the #1 brand when it sells way less than its competition ??? According to syswei, extrapolating from YTD numbers, Lexus will outsell MB by a whopping 40% by year end !!! Easy, because overall sales aren't the end-all like you make them out to be.  Sales is just one component of status or prestige, which is what I'm saying MB is #1 in, not total overall sales.   You are switching up between who is number #1 in prestige vs who is just #1 in sales, and it isn't the same thing.  You put sales as the #1 thing just because Lexus is #1 right now.  Now if Cadillac passes Lexus in sales will that make them a more prestigious brand to you?  Most likely not.  Then you'll  look at other aspects of the prestige question.  You down play price like it doesn't matter.  Mercedes sold over 13K SL's last year for at least 85K a pop.  Now if you're going to get into a subjective thing like status then you have to look at everything and not just a simplistic look at who sells the most overall.  You may choose not to see what I see, and choose not to infer what I infer... that's your choice. My point is clear and backed up with those sales factoids either YTD or going back 6 years.... Problem is you haven't given any factoids about MB not being the #1 choice for the high-end buyer, only a bunch of irrelevant things about sales overall, which wasn't the issue, nor is what you've given the sole indicator of prestige or status.  You also ignore that over those 6 years you keep talking about MB went from 100K to over 200K in sales, at higher prices overall than Lexus, but to you price doesn't matter.   I mean all luxury brands should grow at the same rate no matter what their prices are?  That is being ""objective""?If you want to say that Lexus is #1 sales all day long, no one will disagree, but the majority of those sales are the LexusES and RX, both sub-50K vehicles.  Those are not high-end products, which is where I disagree with you about MB not being the choice brand, not overall sales. Again, if you have the numbers to prove that MB isn't the #1 choice for the high-end buyer (which you estimated to be between 50-80K), and/or that someone else is,  I'd love to see them.   M"
"Next Gen lsshould be priced head-to-head with 7 and A8Should or could?  Imho, it could  be priced at that level and still perhaps outsell the 7 (though offseting the factors you mentioned the 7 will still have the advantage of better...to some...driving dynamics, and despite the survey someone posted could in some people's eyes have stronger prestige/cachet).  That still doesn't prove that Lexus from a corporate standpoint should price it there.  Why do you assume that you know better than Lexus what the profit-maximizing price strategy really is?  Have you conducted your own surveys or focus groups?  These companies do have focus group studies....I was even invited to what was described to me as a ""luxury sedan"" focus group, but unfortunately had a business conflict so didn't attend.Maybe it is the Germans that are over-priced, not Lexus that is underpriced.  Have you thought of that possibility?  That if the Germans had lower production costs than they do in the real world, their profit-maximizing strategy might be to lower their selling prices, not maintain them?Do you understand the concept of price elasticity of demand?  And I'll ask again, do you have a better idea than Lexus of what it is for the LS?  And of what the incremental margins are on the LS?"
"No on is saying that it being cheaper is the sole reason for lsselling better, only that it plays a factor in that ""50 percent"" estimate...Merc1: IYO, what other reasons, other than cheaper price, makes the lsa best-seller in its class ?"
"No one here is under the impression or illusion that smart business doesn't sell cars. The key is to satisfy both sides to a degree like Porsche or BMW does...So you are essentially asking Toyota to be who they are not ! I mean, how can you fault a car business running on auto pilot as the Toyota/Lexus machine is currently on ? They have their DNA in the market, just like you correctly noted for the LS' stellar sales success - sterling reputation for quality and reliability. And that reputation makes them successful... Why change that formula ?Every successful company must carve out a niche/calling card/DNA (call it whatever you like) that the market buys into. BMW has the performance/handling, ditto Porsche, Lexus is the other extreme, solid build quality, reliable machine, and luxurious to boot. Somewhere in the middle (to one side or the other) are the likes of Audi, MB, Jaguar, etc... Some are very successful at it, others struggle at it. Toyota sells cars that MOST people want, not ALL people. Fact is BMW and Porsche COMBINED do NOT have the profitability, market share and share size of the juggernaut called TOYOTA, despite making cars that benefit the so-called performance-biased crowd.... Sucks, but its the truth. Personally, if I were Toyota, I'd be careful to making too many wholesale changes to my DNA... Don't want to upset the applecart, you know... Maybe Merc1 needs a trip to Harvard Business School to better understand what makes Toyota a runaway success it is today... I am sure it will change his perception of Toyota/Lexus forever..."
"No, it's one C&D writer's perception. Someone else, I think it was in R&T, described the ls's handling as greasy so they are at odds. I fully agree with Merc that the lshandles like a boat and is numb. Also, I'll take R&T's evaluations any day over C&D. Exactly. No where in any review did they say the car had handling equal to any of the Euro cars.  That was in the MT comparo in which they said the LS' handling was greasy, the same comparo in which they picked the a8 as the winner.  As Reality2 state the A8 has had its share of wins here, yet the only comparo that matters is the ones that Lexus win, the C&D one. M"
"Then why name it an SUV? Just say GST like the MB R-Class or SAV like Bimmer if they don't won't to be associated with SUV's. But I have to retract my former post. It seems Lexus is indeed getting serious about performance as they've showed an RX350 being hustled around a racetrack by a professional driver with the poor owner to never know what it is to drive his vehicle. A very good look, and huge step foward for Lexus as they've showed the atheleticism of the 3.5L V-6 engine in the commercial. Now to the Q7. The ad pretty much sucked. No arguement out of me on that one Doc and LJ. They could've done much better than that. The A8 when new for '04 ad was vastly better, albeit they stopped showing it after 1 year. I did however just watch a new Q7 ad featuring a ""4-Seasons"" type layout, which undoubtedly zeroed in on the quattro system and the trick 4-level air suspension, which did get some interest out of me. EARTH TO AUDI: I love your cars, but please invest in some great marketing strategies as people will know who we are! Other than that, I'm lovin' it."
"noticed that there were some discussions about the purchasing power of lsbuyers, and what I found to be interesting was that if they are truly an affluent group, why then do the Lexus buyers seem to have an obsession with resale? Would they actually NOT buy a car they otherwise like because of the mathematics of resale?BINGO!Your observations are dead on. The reason is  the lsup to now is not priced like German HELMs but more like German LPS like the 5/E/A6 models. Therefore the lsattracts a different segment of the market  . A market that consists of buyers that are more conscious about resale values than in the market for HELMs. Although the future LWB and Hybrid lsmodels will sell at real HELM prices.I include myself in the above category.  I did buy my BMW 530xi Touring because it is IMO the most driveable family wagon out there.  But another consideration was BMW resale values (I was quite impressed with the the  price I sold my 99 BMW323i).The only HELM auto I would ever consider buying is a Porshce 911 Carrera S. Unfortunately the Carrera S MSRP in Canada is at a  40 percent premium (adjusted for foreign exchange) over over the MSRP in USA.RIP OFF! Pride refuses me to be lured into such a transaction. Nor do I want to go through the hassle of buying a Porsche in USA and confronting duties and warranty issues here in Canada."
"oac - when you say ""dethrone"", what exactly are you referring to? Yeah I'd like to know too.  The only SClass model the lshas ""dethroned"" has always been the entry-level model.  I have never seen a  SClass lose a fight to any lsmodel. Secondly the ""S-Class"" isn't just one car, it is a group of cars and to beat the SClass you have to have something at the top to compete with the upper models, which is why Lexus is going for their faux ""LS600h"" to do battle at the upper end.  When you look at the big picture the lsis hottest car in the segment (by sales) in the U.S, but worldwide the SClass is still the segment leader by far, and if the SClass isn't (as some say) then its the A8. M"
"Oac, you don&#146;t sound like your ol&#146; self with regard to the new lsbut I&#146;d be surprised if you didn&#146;t buy it. Au contraire... I am certainly an LS460 buyer, sight unseen; I have said that repeatedly, even tho' I have NOT seen the car in person yet. Pics, I hear, do not do the new lsjustice enough, especially the 600hL. I am so much looking forward to seeing the new lsseries soon. For the life of me, I could not believe Lexus didn't even let us on the Left Coast see this car ! How so ? I mean, 50% of the LS460/600hL buyers reside right here in SoCal, so why diss us this way, Lexus ?I gather you like the 07 3Series coupe? Please elaborate. I saw a cameo of the new 3-er coupe (front and back) and it didn't look that pretty to me. Like I said, its 5-yrs away before I can justify downsizing the family truck once we become an empty-nester home... When the time comes to buy a sport sedan/coupe/convertible, I will ALWAYS consider a Bimmer... especially a 3-er. I was seriously thinking of an IS350/330i last year but the LX470 won... You know why, right ? :) I drive my friends' e46 330ci/MT enough to love that car... BTW, me no likey the 5 or 7 !!With an lsan LX you can&#146;t rationalize trading the Matrix for the roller coaster ride?Hehehehe.... That's a good one... The wife would not mind me getting rid of the Matrix, but I won't hear it. Need I repeat my oft stated love for my little Trix ? That car is very deceptive in speed. Its a damn dog going up the hill, but on flat or curvy roads, the car rocks... I am often at 90mph without even knowing it. Yes, I admit, I am lead-footed. Got to be out here, as you dang know very well Designman. You must be as well, I suppose, with a Boxter and a 530i... if you are not, I'd be shocked !!"
"Neither IS nor GS were intended to beat 3, 5, C or E on their own. IS and GS were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars. LexusES and RX competed against 325, 525, C240, C280, E320 and their wagon variants; IS and GS competed against 3Series , 530i, 545i, C320, and E500. If anything, one might make the argument that BMW and MB copy each other's product lineups, replete with almost one-on-one sedan and wagon offerings, whereas Lexus took quite a different route. All spin and bs not really worth responding to.  The IS and GS you say - ""were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars"". Dude that is so ridiculous it doesn't warrant a response.  Totally ridiculous. Is that your way of backtracking what you said earlier?? But you are the one spreading the ""rumors,"" whether that rumor has any substance or not. No, it was a way of clearing up what I said earlier, since you didn't seem to grasp it.  Secondly, anything I've said about upcoming products can be readily found in the press and I didn't pass them off as fact, only speculation.  In stark constrast to how most Lexus fans report things. AMG is obviously an MB attempt to copy the success BMW's M division. They compete for the similar clientelles; just look at the numerous comparos. Your argument splitting hair about AMG using AMG and force-induction therefore it's not copying M division is laughable . . . by that logic, Lexus never copied anyone because it packed more electronics, electronics that actually worked, into their cars. Get real. Bull, plain and simple.  AMG goes back to 1967 and BMW's M wasn't even a matter of discussion back then.  AMG has always been about hp more than outright handling like M.  The original AMG ""Hammer"" proves this.  It wasn't a M5 competitors on the track, but would inhale it on the straights. More importantly, my point about copying was that AMG isn't trying to build a BMW in either function or look like LEXUS DID with Mercedes in the past or Lexus now.  Big difference.  You get real and realize that Lexus is all about chasing whomever they think is hot at the moment, that being BMW now in their eyes.  Every car add electronics, not just Lexus.  Every car DOES NOT however have to look like their most direct competitor.  Adding the electronics bs to your post was only more of the same spin as before.  There is no point for anyone else to make an lsexcept for Lexus; nor anyone to make an SClass except MB; nor anyone to make a 7 except for BMW. However, if you can make a better lsthan Lexus, or better S than MB, or better 7 than BMW, and still be able to sell with a competitive value proposition, you have a business plan. The reality is that, nobody in their right mind dares to even try making a better lsthan Lexus. The same can not be said of S (or CLS, like you said ealier). What a pile of contradiction.  The lsstarted out as a copy in the first place!  Have you forgotten this?  For MB to set out to make lsthey'd only be copying SOME of their own previous work and BMW and the rest aren't interested in doing so because a car like the lsdoesn't suite the profile of BMW, Jaguar or Audi.  They aren't trying because they don't need or have to, not because they couldn't.  How much twisting can you do with this ridiculous theory?M"
"Oh ok, sorry if I don't see the relevance here especially when these types of ""points"" are brought up once MB is mentioned. Excuse me, Merc1, but Len's the resident business exec here and his inputs are very much appreciated. On this HELM board, every angle to the car business is looked at, not a one-track driving/handling/performance/HP angle you'd prefer. You should be sorry indeed...And look at you talking SALES, eh ! Well... well.. It does sound great to see MB doing so well sales-wise, until things go sour and you'd not like to hear month-to-month, or YTD, or YoY sales again... heheheheAnd while we are on the topic of MB, Merc1, can you explain why MB sells the new SClass as an  SClass here in Japan, while its an  SClass in the US, especially since both are rated at 387HP ? What gives here ????BTW, in a May 2006 car mag here, the LS600hL is pegged at 430HP, with standard 245/45/19"" rims, compared to the 387HP SClassL, with standard 255/45/18"" rims. The LS600hL however outweighs the S by over 200Ibs... Ouch ! Must be that hybrid motor in the 600hL, eh ?Finally, Toyota has another MB-copy car here in Japan, and its not even funny.... The 2008 Crown Majesta... That car is such a blatant MB rip-off, mimicing the Maybach more than the new S, especially from the rear. When I get back, I'd scan the pic and post it here. The car sports the new 4.6L V8 motor rated at 380HP as well... Its exactly like the lsin front, and a Maybach in the rear. Go figure !!!More to come from the land of the rising sun...."
"Oh, so we should do this by number of innovations rather than their importance to the industry? OK, let's play it your way. Just visit the USPTO site and see how many patents have been issued to Toyota vs MB since 1990. Answer: Toyota 4906, MB 1998.Yes but the question is how many of these patents were for worthwhile technologies. I would consider MB's patent for ESC of greater value than a Toyota patent for a new keyless entry remote. The sheer number of patents means nothing unless you know what the patents correspond to. Also, how do you know that 1500 of those Toyota patents aren't related to one complicated part, like the hybrid drive system?In fact, larger size should help not hurt MB's S injury rates...as can be seen in the data, where the average ""very large"" car does better than the average ""large"" one.Actually larger vehicles have more kinetic energy in collisions, so in a single vehicle crash, lighter (and well engineered) vehicles will fair better. Larger vehicles only have an advantage in multiple car accidents. This is generally the case for all cars, although a well engineered large car will certainly fair better in a single vehicle crash than a poorly engineered small car. The point is the larger size of the S isn't always an advantage although I guess it would be generally. It doesn&#146;t matter anyway because this data is an inaccurate indicator of vehicle safety when the numbers are so close. Your statement might be true if the average age of an S driver were 22 and the average for Lexus were 40, but I think you know better than that. You can't come up with hard numbers and neither can I. My guess is that average for both cars would be in the area of 45-58. IF it is higher for Lexus, do you realize that this would imply a greater number of people over, say 65, who may drive slower but also have slower reaction times and hence might be more accident-prone?Neither of us can provide any hard numbers. But using intuition alone it is easy to understand why an S (or any other MB for that matter) would appeal to a younger, more reckless crowd, in addition to the older crowd that the LexusLS caters to. But again, neither of us can show evidence of this... The bottom line is this: the IIHS injury data doesn't account for age, gender or personality demographics. Location demographics and a certain degree of randomness also play into this. The difference between the two cars in this particular measurement is so insignificant, that you really can't say either way given all the unknowns. However, I would argue that MB is safer because it incorporates more safety features into its cars and has a solid heritage as a safety leader.But Mr. tiag_m5/jovialanus somehow left out part of the C&D comparo: the LS's ""Acceleration is brisk: second best to 60 mph; third in the quarter, at 95 mph, as it showed taillights to three of the four Germans. Yet its fuel economy on our trip tied the Jag's at 21 mpg, topped the Audi's, BMW's, and Benz's by 2 mpg&#148; Wow, so it got second place in acceleration. That doesn&#146;t outweigh the fact that it had the longest in class stopping distance, which in itself is a safety flaw.  Also, you&#146;re kidding yourself if you think different tires would have significantly affected the ls&#146;s performance. You might see a slight improvement, but nothing significant. It&#146;s also interesting that C&D included a pre-refresh MB SClass without the new 7 speed transmission and chose the smallest engine available, theSClass, when a more fair comparison would have been the SClass."
"Oh, wrt the new LS460, so far I have stayed on the sidelines reading everything before commenting. I wanted to read many opinions and see lots of pictures. Appears that overall, MORE people like it than not. That is good. Me, I got my check in hand now. My search for a replacement for my '99 lsis over already. The newly styled LS460 SWB with its 380bhp, mid-20 mpg, 8-speed tranny, auto park, smart card, 7.1 DTS 19-speaker ML, 8GB of HD space for 4000 songs, etc.. etc... has me won over. Another car that should give the Germans fits... And the class redefined all over again. Especially, if the $3K lift of base price over 2006 LexusLS rumor turns out to be true. Can the 335hp S450 touch the LS460 ? I don't think so. Can the 382  SClass touch the LS460 ? Yup. But it will be a battle indeed. The lswill continue to outsell the SClass again, only this time, the sales gap will grow even larger. My prediction... What's yours ? Oh I'll give you the car is very impressive, moreso the technology than the sytling.  The interior looks more or less like a GS or IS with more buttons.  The exterior lost something from the original concept IMO.  The LS460L in particular looks unbalanced to me.  Yes the lswill continue to outsell the SClass I'm sure, but of course a 3K price increase will still put the LS460 under 60K, while a S450 will cost at least 78K. But according to you this won't make a difference so why even bring up sales?  A cheaper car in this segment is going to sell more, common sense to me. On paper at least the LS460 makes the S450, 750, A8 and XJ all seem pointless, but the proof is in the driving and real world evaluations.  I don't really see anything unique besides the 8-speed tranny when the lsis compared to theSClass. The new SClass has a new fancy sound system of its own along with a PCMCIA card slot for storing songs, 1500 song capacity I believe. Unless the driving experience is better than the LexusLS, the LS460 will only win over those already sworn to Lexus, IMO.  The styling is already a let down IMO. BTW, the Audi A/S8's new B&O sound system might end being better than either MB or Lexus. I seriously would question who is using your ID if anything from Lexus didn't win you over.  M"
Oac... put up the LexusES too. It's very close to the LexusLS...As requested...ES350 (rear side profile)LS460 (rear side profile)
"paying a lot more money for a vehicle that is .5 - .9 seconds faster than it's more archaic clone is not a value to meFunny how the MB website proclaims about the new-generation M-Class, ""A New Era of Power Begins""...yet the 2006 ML350 still trails the archaic  RX  by .4 sec, 0-60, and the RX400h by .9 - 1.3 sec.I always find it amusing when germancarfan ""enthusiasts"" downplay acceleration times.  Somehow I imagine that if Lexus edged MB in handling, but trailed in 0-60 times, the germancarfans would be downplaying handling and emphasizing 0-60 times.Do you sell MBs for a living?  How do you sell your customers on an SClass instead of a S350, or a  SClass instead of anSClass, or an SClass instead of a SClass?  Adjusting for equipment other than the engine, MB is still asking for $thousands for each jump up, and $tens of thousands for the jump to theSClass.  Yet this is ok in your eyes (and I assume you do your best to encourage customers to pay up for the hp and torque)...and somehow its not ok to pay for the performance and fuel economy of a hybrid?I'm not the type to pay msrp or higher and I won't be buying a hybrid until the next lscomes out, but hybrid is definitely worth some premium over a plain ICE...just as an  SClass is worth more than anSClass."
"Performance. The LexIthinkIcans can rant all you want about a 3 year old test that the ls""won"", but if the  SClass was there, it would've been an entirely different playing field. True, both the A8 and S is a step behind the 7 in the adhesion department, but the Lexus is, well, Park Avenue-esque in the turns(don't want to sound ""bad""-but it is). So strange that all of sudden MB,BMW, and Audi are getting hammered on performance models of the big cars, but why did Lexus say that the ""600"" will have the performance to hang with the ""big guys""?? Now Lexus has joined the autobahn stormers?? Very interesting indeed. There has already been such a test way back in 2001, the only time the LexusLS faced the  SClass and the  SClass won but of course that old test won't be acknowledged here, only the old tests that matter. M"
"Please tell me (I am incidentally no fan of Lexus) what these unspoken volumes are. I would love to be able to undercut a competitor by 35% or so and deliver a better ownership experience and maybe even a better product. Just think of what Lexus can do with that 30K advantage! Well said, blkislandguy....There are lots of reasons why the lssells at prices lower than the comparable S. The lsis produced cheaper than the S (the legendary TPS comes into play here), the lsdoes NOT yet have the 110+ years of heritage/marque of the MB brand, and more importantly (IMO), the MB is pretty much over-priced for what you get. On the latter, it may play to owners ego owning a high-priced MB sedan, however, the reality is that MB's (C and E) average selling prices are at or lower than comparable Lexus cars (ES and GS), except at theSClass. If Lexus had half as much history and heritage as MB, it'd sell at far higher premium at the HELM level... In time, Lexus will be higher than MB. Check out the GS and IS prices, they are already at or in some cases higher than comparable BMW and MB sedans... The new lswill sell at prices higher than the 7Series and A8, but slightly under the newSClass... but will deliver more bang for your bucks."
"On a somewhat related note, many have commented about the over extension of the MB line with many, many models. An ad in this morning's WSJ trumpets 8, count'em 8, different Lexus vehicles....Let's count them:MBs - C, E, S, CL, CLS, SL, SLK, ML, MLK, Maybach, R, G (12)Lexus - IS, LexusES, GS, RX, GX, LX, SC, ls(8)Lexus = 8MB = 12Who is the proliferator ?"
"Problem is that if you have to mention such cars to make a case for the LexusLS that means the LexusLS is stylistically challenged....That is something we can say about many cars out there today. Style, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. The E and SClass styles are easy on the eye, and not that polarizing. OTOH, the Bimmer is very polarizing and not that easy on the eye. The lsis quite easy on the eye, may not be the most stylistic one of the lux class, but a pleasant-looking car all the same. I'll wager that the next lswill look a whole lot better than the nextSClass.When I look at the new A8, all I see is the grille.... That's not good since the car has so many distinguishing things, especially the interior, but that grill is something else. Not very endearing, imo... Last, but by no means the least is the Jag which is a nice looking, pleasant car in that old British way. I saw the new XK at an auto show earlier this year and it was a beauty if they ever build it *as is*."
"Re: the SCvs. the SL, part of the reason for the HUGE success of the SCis the SL-matching V8 within the Sc430 engine bay. Whether the Lexus built the SCto compete with the SClass primarily, at $25k less is debatable. But the SL, for 3 years, would struggle to outrun the Lexus. I'm sure this was used in ""walkarounds"" often. Won? Won what?  The bottom line is that the SClass is the better car and has been since day one.  For all the speed matching potential you claim the SC430 has it can't use it any way other than in a straight line since it has little to no handling compared to the SL.  Again time to update the rant, the SL550 will easily dispense with any SC430s that dare act like they have any ""sport"" in their DNA.  Doc, the SClass is a better car than the SC430, period.  The SC430 scores last and the SClass wins any and everytime they've faced each other. GAME OVER. THE END. Re: the original SC, having been knocked-off several times (Mazda MX-6 and Buick Riviera the most blatant), and being called, at $45k, ""Possibly the best car on the planet!"" by C&D, the 1992-99 SCresume wants for nothing. It had to be re-engineered to bring the latest safety equipment cars started to bear in '95+, and Lexus had other plans. Not a one of thoese cars even looks anything like the Lexus SC, especially the Buick.  Buick's copy target was Jaguar during those days not Lexus.  The last part about the SChaving to be re-engineered is a nice, grand even, excuse.  Toyota has more money than anyone else and can ""engineer"" a car to meet whatever standards they want.  Period. As Mercedes CLK has ALWAYS shown, matching style with the original SCwas futile, so just slap two doors on an E, and call it a day!First off the CLK isn't based on  EClass  and how do you know that Mercedes was trying to match the SC400?  The fact remains that the original CLK from 1998-2002 saw the SC400 off the market, as to which looks better we will agree to disagree there.  Not knocking the original SC400 either, I liked the car myself, but it wasn't heaven sent like you portray it to be.  Considering Mercedes had several years to build an SCcompetitor, the 1999 CLK430 was another weak effort, hoplessly derivitive of  EClass  sedan, as was it's forebearer.Fact check, the 1999 CLK430 was NOT derived from  EClass .  It was derived from the C-Class platform, unlike the previous 300CE/E320 Coupe which was derived from  EClass . Since you brought up the CL (Comparing it to cars costing half as much smacks of desperation, Merc. You know better!), if Lexus built cars that cost as much as SClass, SL550, or CL55, you wouldn't be so apt to hide in an Ivory tower. I'm not comparing the two cars as a whole, only their styling which the CL blows away any Lexus, still to this day.  Talk about desperation at least I can point to a current Mercedes that has some looks and not live in the past about a car long since out of production, that my friend is desperation in trying to cover for the current SC430's lame duck styling and driving experience.  The SC400 does nothing for the SC430. Mercedes better have an anwser for the 600h! That could be 10-12k sales a year, by itself. No doubt the car will be a hit, but why is that Mercedes is the only one that has to ""come up with something""?  Mercedes won't have a direct answer for the LS600h, as will no other manufacturer.  You know how Lexus doesn't have an answer for a boatload of Mercedes and BMW models. M"
"S8/AMG sales don't matter much in the context of regular A8, S, and lssales; it does matter in an S8 vs. AMG competition, to be joined later with whatever Lexus bothers to offer, bankrolled by its lssales. Which is nothing different from what MB/Audi/BMW does. However this concept gets knocked until Lexus does it, then it is seen as something new and different. M"
"Saw the new R-class wagon today in person. What an ugly POS, sorry ! My daughter called it a *whale* and I couldn't agree more. And wrt a GL class, in the days of low demand for SUV ... timing couldn't be worse for MB thinking it can buy market share with land yatch SUVs in 2006 ? Who is in charge in Stuttgart these days ? Saw an LexusLS, ES330 and SC430 all such stylish vehicles. Not! Let me see if I have this right.  It is wrong for Mercedes to launch a new full size SUV, but when Lexus gets around to replacing the ancient LX470 with an even bigger vehicle they'll be doing the right thing I suppose?  Right?M"
"Posting a content-free response like that, and you call my post ""spin and bs""?? What exactly is MB and BMW's competitor to ES330 if it is not 325i, 525i, C240/280 and E320? Those account for the bulk of 3/5/C/E sales just like LexusES and RX accounting for the bulk of entry-price and mid-size sedan and wagon sales for Lexus. More of the same.  The LexusES is a fwd, blue-hair vehicle. Nobody else makes anything like it anymore.  The E and 5Series models cost way more than the C and 3Series and they aren't the same car to begin with.  BMW and MB don't make a vehicle that targets the ES330!   MB's acquisition of AMG was a direct response to BMW M's success. See how you spin things out of context?  Nobody said anything about how, why or when Mercedes bought out AMG.  The topic of discussion was about copying, which AMG doesn't do when it comes to BMW's M when it comes to the cars they produce.  Period.  If they did Mercedes would be offering manual trannies and they surely wouldn't be making an AMG version of an SUV or crossover vehicle.  The topic was about the cars, not why Mercedes bought AMG. All this talk about Lexus copying others are just old claptrap nonsense from sore losers. Carmakers copy from each other all the time, since the day the wheel was invented. Lexus does not set out to copy leaders; they learn the success of leaders, and set out to overtake leadership. That's something MB is really terrible at. Look at MB's R class, 203"" vehicle length but only 82 cu.ft interior space. Apparently the company does not even deign to learn from its own Chrysler division. All this spin and denial about Lexus copies from the market leaders is just more of the same in the way of excuses for people who can't accept the fact that Lexus learns from, but can't help copy from also, from those same leaders. All this BS about ""core competence"", ""Lexus ran out of staff"" (!) and lumping sales of completely different vehicles are definitiely signs of sore losers who can't accpet the fact that Lexus hasn't hit a home run everytime out the gate.  Nothing more than grand excuse making at its very, ill-concieved best.  The part about Lexus running out of staff is the most ridiculous thing I have read on here since reading how theSClass/760Li aren't luxury cars. Brabus?  Most here don't care about or grasp the meaning of AMG or M type cars so bringing up an even more extreme outfit like Brabus would be utterly pointless to say the least. M"
"Shall we talk about the free fall the LexusLS is doing this year? Of course not because common sense tells us that it is going to drop like a rock with all the newer competition on the market so you harping about the C's sales smacks of desperation to the highest power. The ls's *free fall* in sales is nothing to do with its competition but more to do with its pending model change over. You should know that, Merc1... Lexus has one of the highest owner retention in the industry... Many owners are simply waiting on their hands to buy the LS460 and its other variants... When you see the new LexusLS, why would you not wait another 5 months ???Yeah I said the new LexusES is ugly, it is as ugly as all getout. The right adjective here would be IMO... A car as successful as the LexusES clearly has a lot of things going for it. It is the clear and undisputed leader in its sector... Its not even close... You don't have to like it, but to categorically diss it like you do smacks of hate and lack of objectivity. You simply have a one-track mentality of cars... they should drive like they are on a track otherwise condemn them to the scrap yard... Get real !"
"So the only way Lexus will remain a threat to BMW is when Lexus cars become like BMWs and that is just not going to happen(assuming Lexus knows what is in their long term interests)! My o my ! Are we living in rose-colored houses or what ! Lexus cars to be like BMWs ??? Gotta be kidding... Since when did BMW become the sales benchmark for Lexus to emulate ? BMW lives and dies on sales of the 3Series... Way too dependent on a single model line, don't you think ? OTOH, Lexus makes its hay on the GX, RX, LexusES, LexusLS, and increasingly the IS.... Far more successful lines than BMW. It may hurt your Germancarfan pride to see how Lexus continues to cream most BMW in sales, must be that most buyers prefer Lexus to BMW, isn't it ? Maybe those buyers don't know/care squat about the drivability of a BMW, eh ?"
"So you are essentially asking Toyota to be who they are not ! I mean, how can you fault a car business running on auto pilot as the Toyota/Lexus machine is currently on ? They have their DNA in the market, just like you correctly noted for the LS' stellar sales success - sterling reputation for quality and reliability. And that reputation makes them successful... Why change that formula ? Nope not at all. I don't see why everyone who champions Toyota/Lexus thinks that making an exciting car will ruin the business end. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact if Toyota/Lexus started to cater to even a few enthusiasts their business would grow even further.  Nobody is asking them to change who they are, only to remember that not everyone wants a sensible shoes transportation appliance in every category.  If Toyota made a 350Z killer, a 35K Supra that looked great along with all the other positive attributes the previous Supra had I'd have one in a min!  How is that hurting them?  It isn't. Every successful company must carve out a niche/calling card/DNA (call it whatever you like) that the market buys into. BMW has the performance/handling, ditto Porsche, Lexus is the other extreme, solid build quality, reliable machine, and luxurious to boot. Somewhere in the middle (to one side or the other) are the likes of Audi, MB, Jaguar, etc... Some are very successful at it, others struggle at it. Sorry Oac but this doesn't hold any weight because Lexus doesn't hold anything ""extreme"" in the areas of solid build quality or luxury over Audi, BMW or Jaguar or MB, they're just more reliable.  Those ""others"" as you say thrive in areas in which Lexus doesn't so it isn't nearly black and white as you imply with this statement. Toyota sells cars that MOST people want, not ALL people. Fact is BMW and Porsche COMBINED do NOT have the profitability, market share and share size of the juggernaut called TOYOTA, despite making cars that benefit the so-called performance-biased crowd.... Very lopsided and downright silly to compare BMW and Porsche's balance sheet/market share with Toyota's.  Uh...of course Toyota is going to make more money and have more market share than a luxury car maker like BMW and of course they'll do better than a small high-end sports car maker like Porsche...both brands sell cars for prices Toyota (and Lexus) can only dream about.  However since you brought up Porsche, you should know that Porsche makes more money PER CAR SOLD than any other car company in the world.  Period.  BMW is also in the top 3 of this group. I'm not talking about the dollar amount, but the percentage of profit/return on each unit.  Porsche is #1 in the world at this.  If you're going to compare BMW and Porsche's financials overall to anyone it has to be Lexus, but does Toyota break out the financials for Lexus seperate from Toyota?  Probably not.  While we're talking about market share, why not look at what percentage of the sports car market Porsche has or the luxury car market that BMW has.  Yes I know you'll say that Lexus is #1 here, but BMW isn't a one-market-only-wonder like Lexus. BMW's board likely couldn't be more pleased with their success. Ditto for Porsche and Honda too for that matter. Personally, if I were Toyota, I'd be careful to making too many wholesale changes to my DNA...You just don't get it Oac, no one is asking them to make wholesale changes to their DNA, only to remember that not everyone wants a sedan or suv.  In the past Toyota has made cars like the Supra and Celica and MR2 and up until recently those cars were successful and it didn't hurt their business one bit.  Surely the super smart Toyota could change some things around with those models only in order to grow their business that much more?  If they can't then they're the biggest one-trick pony in the business.  Don't want to upset the applecart, you know... Maybe Merc1 needs a trip to Harvard Business School to better understand what makes Toyota a runaway success it is today... I am sure it will change his perception of Toyota/Lexus forever... Again, the point has been missed here. What on earth does this have to do with the cars sitting on the showroom floor?  No one buys a Toyota or Lexus because of their stellar business practices, though I know certain Lexus/Toyota fanatics here would like to think people do but they don't.  Others have proven that you can run a succesfull, heck a highly successful business while catering to the enthusiast and I'm not even saying that is what Toyota/Lexus should do, they only need one or two models to help shed some of the stick-in-the-mud image.  If you get the sensible shoes buyers and the enthusiasts in the same showroom buying different products you'd have the market truly cornered!  Even LJ can see that. There isn't a place on earth that I could visit outside of a Lexus or Toyota showroom with some or at least one stunning vehicle that would change my perception of Lexus or Toyota.  Again, having solid business end (Porsche or BMW) doesn't mean you have to have dull cars, Lexus' business would grow that much more if they had something, hell anything that lit the fire of an enthusiast.  Keep the yawners like the LS/RX/ES true to form, but their is no reason why the GS, IS and that upcoming sports car have to be so dull and yawn inducing.  This implication that a solid business can't be had while appealing to enthusiast, in Toyota/Lexus' case just a little not a wholesale change, is just total nonsense.  Toyota has managed to do just that before even conservative types like Honda manage to do it.  If Honda can do such with a cars like the S2000 or Civic Si that blows this (Toyota) theory about good business has to made or can only thrive on boring cars right out of the water!All this about Toyota being a runaway success is a double-edged sword because there is slow buildup of evidence that Toyota's lock on reliability/quality is slipping right along with all this success (increased production).  cont...."
"So you are saying a single  SClass model is enough to hold off the LS460, LS460L, LS600hL, 7Series, 7SeriesL, A8, A8L, XJ ?? No, does it look like I'm saying that?  I clearly stated that I don't think it would be the right thing for them to introduce a S450 RIGHT NOW for the reasons Tagman and I mentioned before.  Mercedes doesn't have to ""hold off"" the lsnor could they as far as sales go because we all know the lsis going to be cheaper.  You missed the point entirely it seems. MB needs another one to supplement the  SClass pretty quick. By next spring, the LS600hL arrives here, and MB suddenly has 3 lsseries sedans to battle against using one SClass, or maybe a possibleSClass. Nonsense. They don't need anything ""pretty quick"" because as it stands now the  SClass is selling a rate not previously seen for theSClass.  The point is as time goes on and the competition increases they'll start to add more variants which is no different that what MB and BMW for that matter have done for years and years.   And I don't count the very low volume S63/S65 here. You don't have to as far as your sales theories go, I mentioned them because these are variants that MB will build - point being they'll have enough already without adding a S350 CGI like Tagman hinted at. This whole ""who will be tops in sales"" thing is really irrelevant until either Lexus prices like MB (which I'm not suggesting they do) or until MB drops prices to compete directly with Lexus.  We all know the Lexus will be thousands cheaper and common sense says it should sell better especially that SWB LS460 which won't even be close to a starting price of the current SClass.  If there were an S450 coming for this fall it would have been at the NY show like all the other MY2007 updates were.  So as it stands the price of entry to the ""S-Class"" will be around 87K (for now at least), likely 20K or more above the price of where the LS460 will base at.  M"
"Someone else, I think it was in R&T, described the ls's handling as greasy so they are at odds. I fully agree with Merc that the lshandles like a boat and is numb.First, let me remind people that although I don't have as many cars as blkhemi (but then who does?), I have owned BMW, MB and Audi cars in the past (and still own 2 MBs).I spent the last weekend driving from DC to Philly and back (attending a funeral) with my family in my '05 LexusLS.  This car does not have the ""impossible-to-find"" Euro suspension, but does have the 18"" all-season low profile Dunlop tires.Real world test:  everyone in my family (one front seat and two rear seat passengers, and me as driver) enjoyed the ride.  The GPS worked great getting us around without any maps in unfamiliar places (used the override sequence to enable changes in Destinations while driving - a must do!), the ride was smooth and quiet, the brakes worked beautifully in the one accident avoidance maneuver I had to make, and the seats were comfortable (even for me who has a very bad back from failed back surgery).  It did not handle like a boat, and the steering on my car is extremely tight - if anything, it takes more effort than I might like (this may be a function of the sticky 18"" tires).I admittedly rarely go more than 10 mph above the speed limit, so 75 mph is more my reality than 110+ mph on the Autobahn.  I could understand why someone in Germany would choose an SClass or 760 0ver an lsfor that reason, but I don't live there.The only knock I have on this car is the uninspired styling (interior and exterior). But looks like even that will improve with the upcoming LS460.If I were going to drive aggressively at high speed darting in and out of traffic (like one person I saw on I-95 yesterday in a M45), I'd go with hpowders' 545 or a tuner version E or 5Series.  I certainly wouldn't choose an S, an A8, or even a 7 for that.  But the reality is I don't want to drive like that.  I do like to take corners relatively quickly, and my lsactually does that better than my E320.  Sorry, merc1 and Tagman, at least shod with performance tires, the lshandles very well.  Drive one with these tires (but without the ""Euro suspension"" which is how they are coming to the dealers these days), and I think you may change your one-note tune.  But of course, even more relevant for the future will be how the LS460 handles, and NO ONE HAS DRIVEN ONE YET!Hey, I am just thankful that I, the grandson of immigrants who came here with nothing but the clothes on their backs, have the right and the capability to choose among these fine vehicles.  Ain't America great!"
"Sometimes though you guys make it seem like the S (and Mercedes itself) is going to all of a sudden stop selling because of the new LexusLS, that is nonsense. Me thinks so... Nahhhhh !!! just pulling your legs... Lighten up, will ya !Not discounting the business end, just saying that it isn't relevant to us talking about cars. OK... I hear you...You'll be unhappy to know that the GS is already down in sales just a year after introduction. That Infiniti M that you claimed wouldn't matter in the sales race due buyers not wanting a sportier car in that segment has managed to outsell your GS last month. I seem to remember a lot of hype this time last year about how the GS was going to do so much and yet its already hitting the skids. Go figure. I have said it many times I am no GS fan, so this does not really apply to me... I test drove the new GS300 and M35 when they both came out, and if you recall my test drive write-up on the sedan comparison board, it showered lots of praise on the M35. I loved the car and so were my kids who begged me to buy the car right there... (they came along for the ride)... Yes, the M is a better car than the GS.... currently. However, to its credit, the new GS came hobbled - 245HP GS300 (too low) and 300HP GS430 (carry-over motor) - knowing there was a GS350 and GS460 due within 18 months of the March 2005 release, may have something to do with its declining sales after only 12 months in the market. If I know I can get a 315HP GS350 in a matter of 6 months from now, why would I buy a 245HP GS300 ? And if I can get a 380HP GS460, should I pony up the $$$ for a GS430 ? Think the market does not know about the new GS twins coming real soon ? Even Lexus expects it to be so... Especially with an IS350 with 306HP (actual 325HP on old SAE standards) selling cheaper than a GS300... The mid-cycle refresh for the GS couldn't come any sooner..."
"Sorry, Doc, I truly do believe that to move Lexus even faster than they are already moving would be ""hazardous to their health"". Gotta agree with tagman here. Lexus is not under-priced. MB is over-priced. The pricing of the next lsshould not be focused on theSClass. Instead, Lexus should consider the purchasing power of the marketing and cost cutting through better technology and management. If Lexus keeps on delivering good cars at a justified price, then MB has but only two options:1) lower it's price and compete head on2) raise it's price and follow the steps of Rolls RoyceP.S. I sure hope Lexus build cars in China. In that way, we may buy an ES350 at $25000 or an LS460 at $50000. And yeah, kill the competition."
"Still speculation for now, but something tells me MB is not thinking like you. They will see the LS600hL as a direct competitor to theSClass. The LS460L is a match for the SClass/7SeriesL, so expect the 600hL to go right against theSClass/760iL/A8L... Don't think so ? Just wait and see... Yeah we'll see because as of right now 430hp ain't gonna cut it against theSClass, IMO.  If they price it like a SClass then maybe, but we know they won't do that.  I suspect the LS600h will be a 100K car, not 140K.  I'll even give you that in a sense or in most people's mind it will compete with the SClass because they're calling it a ""600"" too.  I won't get into what I think about that, but of course many will shop both cars, but let me be clear it is the performance is where I don't think the LS600h will be able to keep pace with theSClass. Now a G SClass sounds good, but what would it compete with?  Gonna have to be hella powerful to contend with the E63 or M5. Nah I think you'll see a GS460 with 380h to compete with the 360hp 550i and 382hp E550. The GS450h isn't produced in enough numbers to replace the GS430/460 in that space. M"
"Tagman - I don't like the new SHoly smokes!  The new SClass is freakin' GORGEOUS!  Give me a break, here.  There are going to be a lot of trade-ins going on later this year for both the new lsand the new S.  I'm not a big 7Series fan, but I admire the car. And, I do actually believe the Lexus lsis nice, but the price MUST be right to do well, IMO.  And, for whatever personal reason, I've always just loved the Jaguar XJ, especially the newest generation aluminum Vanden Plas & Portfolio.This new SClass is one of the most beautiful Mercedes Benz ever built, IMO, inside and out!  And, as I have said all along, it will sell well.  No doubt about it.TagMan"
"Talking about MB, it is a highly prestigious brand, no doubt, but what I was saying is that buyers today have more choices when buying high end lux cars than in the past, say decades ago. And the increased wealth in the US certainly provides the fodder for many to afford all sorts of luxury cars. WIth Audi, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, VW, etc... MB can no longer dominate the lux space as int he past. Decades ago?  Whats the point?  This is common knowledge that from decades ago that MB isn't the only choice in town, they never were, only the most popular one for the high end buyer, which was the point of your original post.   Lexus wasn't even around ""decades ago""?   MB is still the most prestigious out of the mainstream luxury brands either way you want to word it.  BMW and Audi have always been around so I really don't get what you're trying to say here, and Mercedes has held prestige over them every since.   BMW can't sell anything past the 7Series in price and they've tried twice in the last 15 years with the Z8 and 850i, both came up short.  You say that Mercedes can no longer dominate the luxury space?  Then who does?  Or we need to determine what is the luxury space?  Is it 30K on up or it where the real luxury cars are, imo somewhere around 60K and up.   Between that point of where the mid-size luxury cars taper off, around 60K or so to somewhere over 100K Mercedes is dominant.   Audi and Infiniti have big time trouble selling anything over 60K, especially Infiniti.  Lexus has but one sedan and a coupe that sell for over 60K, and the SC430 doesn't break 70K like the LexusLS does.    BMW does a lot better above that point and Mercedes is the clear leader there so I don't see any basis for your point, it seems like reaching for something that simply isn't there, at least right now.  For the high-end buyer some type of Mercedes is still ""the car"" whether that ranking is deserved or not.  Between the CLS, SL, CL, S, and other various AMG models Mercedes moves more high-dollar hardware both here and around the world than anyone else in the mainstream luxury sector.  Sure when you talk about Aston-Martin, Bentley, Ferrari and others Mercedes is not as prestigious and can't command the same prices.  The 450K SLR is a rare thing.  Even I, as much as I like the Mercedes CL or SL, would take an Aston-Martin DB9 over either one of them.   No one here has seen the new S in person or the lsat all so there is no way for anyone to know how the cars will match up in person.  The SClass sales of the last few years are supposed to drop,  its a 7 year old car.  Even still it outsells all the Euro competition in the U.S. and around the world, only the much cheaper lsoutsells it, and in this country only.   That to me says Mercedes' prestige or dominance isn't even in question.   When the SClass or  EClass  for that matter lose their positions both here and around the world then you may have a point.  In the lower ranks its BMW who is red-hot obviously with everyone chasing the 3Series, been that way for years.  Mercedes was never the dominant choice when it came to their smaller cars.  M"
"Tell me, Merc1, what do MB and BMW have that Audi does not have ? A 12-cylinder super sedan ? Sport-biased cars ? Racing history ? Heritage ? Even sales on a global basis.... When you mention MB/BMW, pls include Audi. Audi is as much a HELM company as MB and BMW ! Ditto Jag (gotta acknowledge Blkhemi and TagMan's request here). Only Lexus needs to be propped into the HELM class on the strenght of its lssedan. As Lexus adds more to its upper cadre cars, it will become a solid HELM company - lsseries, GT450, and potentially another super sedan above the 600hL... Audi doesn't have the product spread that BMW and especially Mercedes-Benz has for one.  Audi is rapidly changing this and of course they have nearly everything else MB/BMW has so you're right, but when I said that Audi wasn't a a HELM I was thinking primarily in the U.S. market.  Audi as it stands in this country right now they only have one HELM car, the A8/S8/A8L.  As far as propping up a brand with one car that competes in the HELM space, Audi is pretty much in the same boat as Lexus in that regard, but you're right their other qualities put them nearly equal footing with BMW and Mercedes-Benz but that disqualifies Lexus outright because they have none of those other things you mentioned in regards to Audi.   Trust, you don't have to build Audi up to me because I think they're 90 percent as good as anything BMW/Mercedes makes.  They just don't have the lineup at the moment and they realize this as does Lexus.  Everyone does bottom 2 sedan categories and most do the S/LS/7/A8/XJ segment, but even fewer do the convertible/sports cars/roadster segments like BMW and especialy MB. Lexus on the other hand doesn't have anything even remotely interesting outside the sedan category and even there they lack any real lust objects.  There is no way possible you can be a High-End Luxury Marque with just one car (a sedan) that competes at the true high end, otherwise VW is also a HELM too and we all know they aren't.  That is why this:BTW, the word ""marques"" does not imply a brand with more than one marque car, but rather more than one car company with at least a marque car that fits into the HELM topic on this board. doesn't fly.  Marque does indeed mean a brand not just one sedan that barely gets past 70K which happens to be where BMW and again, especially Mercedes have no shortage of models competiting or any trouble selling.  Otherwise the thread needs to be changed to High-End Luxury Sedans, not Marques. As Lexus adds more to its upper cadre cars, it will become a solid HELM company - lsseries, GT450, and potentially another super sedan above the 600hLTrue, but in the NOW Lexus don't cut it as a true HELM.  No propping should be needed. M"
"No!  You can't be serious! :mad:    The only car/truck/suv more bought, stripped, and dissected by it's ""Competition"" than the Lexus RX is the 3Series, and I'm probably wrong on that!   Buick Rundesvouz, Mercedes ML350, Kia Sorento, Saturn Outlook, Chevy Equinox, et al, are all beneficiaries of Lexus DNA, albeit by artificial insemenation.    The RX is clearly the best premium SUv on Earth, and apparently everyone but you has gotten the memo.    GM, Acura, Mercedes, and especially Audi have serious wet dreams about building an RX300.

"That lscar is coming out to steal the thunder of the new SClass in the most important market in the world for the SClass and will cost $10K+ less (in many but not all cases) and will have a lot more horses and more technology. We'll see about that.  The LS460 has 380hp and the  SClass has 382hp so I don't know where you're getting ""more power"" for the lsfrom.  I guess you're comparing the LS600h to the SClass?  If Lexus wants to badge their car as a ""600"" in their usual wannabe attempt to imply status then they need more than 430hp to get with a real ""600"", a SClass that is. I understand what you're saying about Lexus and their long term strategy, but homer (i.e. the average buyer) couldn't care less about that, they're looking at the car not Lexus' business model. With all the quality problems Lexus' parent Toyota have had lately with Avalons and Camrys I wouldn't get too cocky about Lexus being so untouchable.  Lexus was so lucky to have the Camry to come to market first so their owners would suffer those transmission failures first allowing Lexus to make sure it didn't happen on the ES350. M"
"That would also put the 2007 lsand 2007 S new styles out at the same time...Maybe this is the real intention. BMW already launched its re-do 7SeriesL, ditto Audi's A8L.

"That&#146;s NOT what Oac said. YOUR point is quite easy to grasp. Oac&#146;s original statement is the point of contention. The problem is you&#146;re both trying to make it sound like you are on the same page. It&#146;s a classic case of husband defending wife even though wife is clearly wrong. In this case it&#146;s a marriage of Lexican cronies, double talk and waffling. Sorry, I ain&#146;t buying it for a minute. Whew!  I'm glad you said this because that is exactly what all of that was.  Lexus' whole being was founded on being a comparable car to the Germans for less money, that was the ""value"" in getting a Lexus over a BMW and especially a Mercedes-Benz.  Everytime you read about these cars being compared you'll see where xxx thought that the lswas a better value than xxxx and so on, now we're supposed to believe that value has nothing to do with it.  More Lexus double speak. M"
"Thats because Mercedes has always been in the middle of a BMW and a Lexus in terms of sportiness....Hate to get in the middle of a food fight, but I'd argue that the word *sport* and the cars we debate on this forum - S, 7, A8 and ls- do not belong. So I'd suggest we eschew the word *sport* from this forum permanently, imo, cos no one buys these large sedans because of their *sportiness*...."
"So when they tell me the lsis the best car they've ever driven or had, they are either hallucinating, fibbing or maybe you just don't have a clue about how 95-99% of drivers evaluate a car. I don't doubt your vision of what a pure enthusiast wants but I seriously doubt you give proper evaluation to what just about every other driver is looking for.Now you know what 95-99 percent of buyers look for? Due tell. I gotta ask why is that your particular circle is supposed to count for the majority of lsbuyers? I can only imagine that the Mercedes name is dirt within your circle and Mercedes can't do anything right. My original point was that the LexusLS didn't handle as well as the German cars in the segment. Period. All this about who bought what and why wasn't my focus.  I know there are plenty of former Mercedes owners driving Lexuses now, again that wasn't in dispute especially concerning the LexusLS.  Now you say that your circle says that the lsis the best car they've ever driven?  The actual reason as to why they say this would be more helpful here, not the usual gloss over about Lexuses being the ""best"" with nothing to back up the belief.  This group you speak of has never had a problem with any Lexus in years and years and they seem to be the happiest bunch of buyers on the planet.  I find it all kinda silly at this point because to them (and you) Lexus is absolutely perfect.  This about the handling has been drawn out just because you and Oac either couldn't handle that a Lexus isn't tops in every category and/or it was dismissed by saying that a lot former Benz owners drive ls's now.  I mean really does it take all that rigamarole? I can see why some of them would fall in love with a Lexus, but there are others here (outside of your circle) that come back to MB after the Lexus experience gets too boring. BTW many of these people also have moved to the RX, the GX, the LX, the GS, have picked up an LexusES for their spouse and now an IS (or SC) for kids or as a toy. But keep on thinking it's only the lsdoing the job if that is what you want to think.Good for them, this can (and does) happen with any buyer that discovers a new brand and has a good experience with it.  Keep thinking that the majority of Lexus owners are former MB owners.  Those days are over and the only Lexus model that really did (or does) any converting is the LexusLS.  People trade all types of cars in on other brands, but with Lexus it was always the lsthat brought in the highest percentage of MB owners.  The other Lexus models don't attract any more MB owners than they do any other brand.  You could stop the average GS,ES,RX or LX buyer and I bet they didn't own a Mercedes before, but with the lsyou'll get more that did. This about all of Lexus' models getting the ""job done"" means what?  What 'job' is that?  A mass exodus away from Mercedes?  Yeah sure. The main reason a MB owner would trade to a Lexus is reliability, not the way the car drives, provided they could actually tell the difference in the first place, which I'm convinced some in your circle were clueless about if they find the LexusLS to be the best ""driving car they've ever driven"". Wish I knew what that meant exactly, but I'd guess it is all about silence, nav and sound systems being perfect rather than anything actually relating to how the car actuallly ""drives"".  Just my guess going by what I see written here about why a Lexus is so good. Lastly, if some Germancar buyers are willing to sacrafice some relibility for a better driving experience (not riding experience which is what most of Lexus' biggest defenders talk about) then the reverse is true. I've read it here before from Lexus owners, they'll give up some of the driving experience, style etc. for a more reliabile vehicle.    M"
"the C&D comparo started with a disclaimer that the lsis not the type of vehicle usually reviewed by the magazine, to me means take the finding with a huge grain of salt. Really ? I would have thought the opposite, cos like many Eurofans here, these mags have their biases as well and would not have thought to expect a floaty, luxo-cruiser, snoozemobile like the lsagainst the likes of the 745, A8, andSClass. Who would have thunk dat ??? I see how hard it is for any of your Eurofans even to accept that comparo. Figures..."
"The Corolla did indeed do better, but these cars still did worse. It doesn't look like a definitive conclusion here. Despite what anyone says, there is no hard data to confirm what either party is saying.The reason that the Elantra, Forenza, Spectra and Beetle received poor ratings despite the airbags is because of their structure. I understand that structure play a crucial role in the performance of a vehicle in a crash. But it seems to me that airbags are just as important. A car with a good structure will still perform poorly in a side impact if it doesn't have side airbags... just the same as a car with side airbags will perform poorly without a good structure. For the sake of simplicity, we'll hypothetically assume that the structure of the lsand the S are the same. With a side airbag, you're going to suffer less trauma to your torso and pelvis than without. If that isn't an admission what is? You're comparing someone wearing Reeboks to ballerina shoes...This isn't rocket science...BTW Euro Sport is a no cost option, whereas the  SClass is a 30K price difference. I still don't think C&R would shame themselves and completely discredit their own review by saying that it was unfair. I do remember the quote you were referring to, but I thought it was little more than a disclaimer... after all, they did award first place to the car with lateral grip worse than a Silverado. Even if the lsdid have the sport option it certainly wouldn't be any BMW. Lexus' approach to ""sport"" isn't exactly impressive either. Someone needs to post the full performance specs from the CR review with the SClass and LexusLS w/sport...  The Euro-Sport package costs $220, not to mention you won't be able to find one anywhere. The difference between the SClass and the  SClass is roughly $10k, and some of that translates into more standard options aside from the larger engine. I just hope Mercedes drops the 430 from its lineup and puts the 500 as its base when the new S comes out. It wasn't impressive at all. If I remember correctly the CD changer was still in the trunk as well. I didn't see what is so ""Athletic"" about it. Maybe the  SClass is different, I didn't drive it so I don't know.Having the CD changer in the trunk is a very minor detail in my opinion. I would rather have the rear side airbags and forgo the convenience of an in dash changer. You probably didn't see what was so ""athletic"" about the S because you didn't push it. With the ABC sport mode activated and ESP off, you'd be surprised how fun the S can be to drive. For $78K you are getting more because you are paying more! Compare a $71K LexusLS Ultra to get a better idea of value.Well there are a few more optional features on the SClass that aren't available with the LexusLS... Granted you do pay more. The $7k difference between the LexusLS Ultra and the SClass is justifiable enough for me. I don't mind paying a bit more for the added safety, performance and style of the S regardless of how large or small the difference really is. If reliability and value were what I was after I would get the LexusLS... Different people have different priorities I guess.Maybe BMW has the highest residual value overall, but the LexusLS has the best in class one of 64%. So not only does it cost less, it holds its' value better too.I don't mean to nitpick but according to ALG the Mercedes-Benz CLK has the best resale in the ""luxury"" class. Granted the lsprobably does have the best residual out of the S, 7, A8, etc... Just an FYI.I think you will all agree spending $60K on any car is not a fully ""Logical"" decision. So it is no surprise we see alot of emotional debate on this board.Amen."
"The fact of the matter is that I'm still content on what I like, just like most of the G-car fans here. You like to ride, I like to DRIVE. No biggie, just differences of preferences.Ride v Drive, eh ? I believe I do DRIVE all of my cars fairly regularly. I also do hitch a RIDE with a friend or business associate once in awhile.... Is that what you meant, BlkHemi ?BTW, what will be the difference b/w driving an a8 and driving an LexusLS ? Both have four wheels, four doors, a steering, powerful V8 motors, 6 cogs, etc... The a8 is plush, longer wheelbase, beautiful interior, and a tad slow compared to its peers. The lsis plush, shorter wheel base, beautiful interior and ergonomics, and as fast as its peers, even with the smallest displacement. Excessive road noise, and high NVH ain't fortes for HELM cars. All of these HELM cars have similar attributes with small differences - marketing, brand, and perception - in the buying public domain.Let me answer my own rhetorical question about a8 v ls: mostly suspension/wheel setup. Remember, HELM owners mostly don't care about skidpads and all that other mushy stuff"
"No one said anything about the abolishment or demise of Lexus. Lexus is here to stay and we all know this.Re-read the post and you'll understand that all was said was that Lexus is not immune from deficiency. You can't make this into one of your Team Lexus shouting matches.Talking about something that should've never came across the Pacific, the laughable ES250(circa 1990) and the previous-gen IS300 was an inert attempt by Lexus to encroach on the market by offering mal-performing cars at cheap prices. Witness the GS, a car that went from '98 to '04 without a single major update(besides a upgrade from 400 GS430). The new GS needs: A new engine, a touter suspension, and styling revisions already? This from the makers of PERFECTION? Paaleeeesssseeeee. Appalling to say the least. Lexus even admits that it had to do this in order to stay competitive(or lack thereof) with the E/5/A6. Still, if it had to be Japanese, the M35/45 walks on it all day long..."
"The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety would probably disagree with you. You seem to ignore that frame construction is the Number ONE factor whether it be an airplane or car.Wrong. That article mentions that a good structure is necessary in addition to side airbags. A good structure alone simply isn't enough. Besides, why does it matter? You talk as if Lexus has a better structure than Mercedes when there is plenty of evidence that points to the opposite. Notice he's saying the same thing I am: Structure is key. Had any of you had an engineering background like I do, you might understand that. An Airbag isn't going to compensate for a lacking structure.A strong structure isn't going to compensate for lacking an airbag either. Assuming that Lexus has a strong frame will never compensate for the fact that they penny pinch on vital safety features like side airbags. Again, I would argue that MB, BMW and others have some of the strongest structures available. For example, if you look at the IIHS crash test details for large luxury cars and luxury SUVs you'll notice that BMW and Mercedes usually have the lowest crush levels of all comparable cars tested. With the BMW X5 ""Measured intrusion into the compartment was less than in any other vehicle we have tested."" How's that for structure for you. On the other hand, Lexus is still having problems with a weak structure/safety cage on the  RX . You've already read in prior posts that the LexusLS structure is studied at various engineering schools. The LexusLS scores equally well in every objective measure out there. You offer opinions, yet I have facts to back up what I say. Not that I wouldn't mind the extra airbag, but it's not going to make a major difference as shown in the results I've posted above. What are you talking about? The LexusLS has been tested in ONE objective test for a frontal impact at 40mph. As I have already explained, crash tests are nice but they don't reveal the whole picture. There are an infinite number of real world crashes that Lexus is never held accountable for. You have no idea how the LexusLS would perform at a higher impact speed, a different offset width, a different angle, roll over, etc. The comment about engineering schools is nonsense to say the least... You offer opinions, yet I have facts to back up what I say. Not that I wouldn't mind the extra airbag, but it's not going to make a major difference as shown in the results I've posted above.But you haven't provided any facts. All you've done is tried to mitigate Lexus' disregard for safety. Contrary to what you said, that link above shows a MAJOR difference in crash performance. Of the cars with ""good structures"" like the Corolla, just look at what a difference equipping optional side airbags made in its performance. Before the side airbags the driver of the Corolla would have sustained life threatening injuries. With the side airbags, the driver would have walked away. Now imagine this impressive difference applied to back seat occupants of your LexusLS and you'll understand. You're still taking that comparo out of context. Go back and read the article. They did say it wasn't a fair comparison, and likened the LexusLS to wearing slippery ballerina shoes if I remember the quote correctly. And No, the Lexus never scores dead last in anything. It's usually in the higher end of straight line acceleration and middle of the pack in other performance realms. You can bluster all you want but even the Autorags give Lexus it's due.Everything you just said is blatantly inaccurate. Nothing I said was out of context. Again, read the article, Car and Driver NEVER said the test was unfair. Why would they discredit their own review? That doesn't even make sense. Second of all, YES the LexusLS DID score dead last for overall performance. It only scored well from 0-60, but in every other aspect, the LexusLS score well behind the rest. Give me a break, the lshas lateral grip worse than most pickup trucks. 18 inch tires aren't going to magically whisk the lsfrom worst to best in class... It simply isn't possible. You didn't even answer my question... why can't I compare an  SClass with an LexusLS but you can compare a Euro-Sport lswith anSClass?I've driven a SClass and no, the difference was not huge. The SClass was stripped of options for $78K (List price). The Navigation system wasn't close to that of the LexusLS. Lexus has been using a DVD based system since 2001, MB 2004. As far as electronics go, Lexus is much better no contest. The Benz looks better and feels marginally better on the highway at 90 MPH. The Lexus has better resale value.The difference is huge though. I won't argue with you that the S is more expensive because it obviously is. All I'm saying is that you get that much more out of the extra cost. Also, you're wrong about the Navigation system. DVD navigation has been standard on the SClass since 2003 and navigation is still optional on the LexusLS. Not to mention that the SClass is more athletic than the lsby ten fold. How are electronics no contest in Lexus' favor? Mercedes offers all of Lexus' features and then some. And as long as you brought up resale value, I would like to point out that BMW has the highest luxury residual value.You keep harping on about Innovation...My answer: We don't care who built it first. So as long as it works. Basically you're making the snob appeal argument, that's what it all boils down to.The only reason I mention innovation is because it represents the priorities of the company. With Lexus, the priority is reliability. With Mercedes, the priority is obviously safety as can be seen by their dominance in this area. And it isn't even just innovation... you refuse to accept that Lexus has fewer safety features and is slow to market with new innovations. No one is making a snob appeal argument... I simply pointed out the facts and you refuse to accept them as valid for some reason. Sorry, I don't buy my car as status symbol to brag about. I think that perfectly illustrates the difference between Lexus owners and Mercedes owners.Wow, that was a pompous and snobish statement if there ever was one. It's the same reason I wear a Seiko instead of a Rolex. Reliabilty is better and it does the same exact thing...So why spend $10K for show?Apples and oranges.  <"
"The 1998-2005 GS was an experimental entry to a new segment for Lexus. The car certainly did better than R-class upon introduction. Heavy discounting started only 3-4 model years after introduction unlike the R-class. Frankly, GS sales did/does not matter to Lexus, unlike  EClass  to MB. Now this is desperate brightness.  The 1998 GS was an expirement, but the 2006 R-Class isn't? What bs, not to mention a big-fat-excuse for the 1998 GS having flopped after the 2000 MY because the 1998 GS was the second generation of the GS, hardly a new segment/experimental car like the R-Class is.  The R-Class isn't replacing a current Mercedes, unlike the 1998 GS did.  The first generation IS300 was an experiment, but the 1998 GS wasn't. Lexus has core competence such as RX, LexusES and lsthat account for 70-80% of total sales volume and never need heavy discounting, whereas MB does not have a single model line that can hold its price up through a model run, some heavily discounting shortly after introduction. That is indicative of massive prestige loss . . . in more technical and relevent terms: massive loss of brand equity. Yeah right, I guess the previous GS and IS were selling for sticker as is the current SC430.  You're not dealing in reality if you think these models weren't discounted or that the current SC430 isn't being discounted now.  You think the LexusLS, who's sales are dropping this year isn't being discounted at all?  Yeah right. To say that a model like the GS doesn't matter to Lexus is nothing more than a big fat excuse.  If the car didn't matter they wouldn't have redesigned it!  Don't tell the other Lexus fans here that the GS' sales don't matter because it has now become a huge part of the typical Lexus sales speech. M"

"The Lexus ""image"" IS GOING TO SHIFT closer to BMW. This will be based upon their very own model line-up, not marketing hype. One good look at the designs of their newest vehicles tells all. As I said before, the Bimmers were already out there, and NOW you see the latest from Lexus showing HUGE similarities. It is OBVIOUS that they did not by some mere coincidence come up with such similar design lines.I&#146;d like to know what you are talking about. The LF-Sh bears a slight resemblance to the LexusES which preceded the 5 and was out at the same time as the 7. Both  the LexusES and Camry are slab-sided so they weren&#146;t copying BMW. The new BMWs show so much copying that it&#146;s ridiculous. For example, the concave shoulder on the 5 is a ripoff of the Lincoln LexusLS. The Bangle butts come from Chrylser, Honda, Mazdas of years ago.The rear of the LF-Sh not only resembles the LexusES but also the Mazda Millenia. The front stands on its own. BMWs are about a lot of scar-tissue surfacing, aka flame surfacing. There is no flame surfacing on new Lexuses. Lexus is clearly trying to hitchhike onto 3Series dominance but they are not doing it with styling. Rather it is a performance appeal solely via horsepower. Let me know if you see lsadvertising going after the 7Series with flames coming out of the road like they did with the IS. It ain&#146;t gonna happen. Is there enough of a 7Series market share for them to go after it? Lexus is coming into its own niche with the LexusLS, some 17 years after being the Ultimate Following Machine. Heh, heh, that was great Merc. I&#146;m surprised you didn&#146;t use that sooner. Or maybe you have?The question is, will the new lsup the ante with handling like Mercedes did with the S. It says no here. In that regard it will be a little better than a Town Car. And it will need more than 20-inch wheels to do it. 7Series buyers want nothing to do with an LexusLS. It&#146;s like trying to mate cats and dogs."
"The LS460L, SClass, 750Li, A8L, and XJL will be the contestants.When you think about it, the outcome is fairly predictable.TagMan"
"The lsdoes NOT need any paper listing of features to dethrone the 7 and S. It already did, 15 of the last 17 years.... Get it ? Yes I get it. Lower priced luxury items usually sell at greater volume.It will be interesting to see how Hyundai's new RWD H.E.L.M. will sell? A luxury Hyundai may be ridiculed at first but may end up selling at the highest volume because of its price. Does that not sound familiar to the Lexus LexusLS, especially 16 years ago?"
"The majority of reviews do NOT say much different. I do NOT read that the car has a reputation for seductive styling, exhilerating performance, tremendous handling, or a kick-in-the-pants drive. It is NOT a style leader, but a handsome-enough successful-appearing adequately styled vehicle. It won't starve anyone, but it won't fill 'em up either. That IS the Lexus story so far. Nicest Japanese rendition of reliable transportation so far. I'll give you that, but give me a break, the Lexus just doesn't tend to quicken the pulse. Every car has their attributes, and are designed for a purpose. Does it tell you something that this car happens to be the best selling luxury full-size sedan in America ? Does it tell you something that of the 745, XJR, A8, SClass, LexusLS, most Americans prefer the LexusLS over these other cars ? They must want something that the lsprovides, whatever that is, much more than whatever the Germans provide in this market space. Enjoy your heart and soul car, whatever that is. The lsis not for you, find what appeals to you and enjoy it. Its your money do whatever you like with it. But do not question the motives of others who choose the LexusLS."
"The new 2007 LexusLS. Now there's a car I will probably buy! Sometimes, you just have to think smart!! Sounds very smart! But I prefer the lower IQ alternative!Thank God for those BMW-subsidized leases because now I can afford a BMW M5 versus paying the same amount for a unsubisidized lease on a Lexus ES330"
"The old Jack Daniels bottle most be pretty low as this is one of the most far-fetched comments made here. Unbelieveable.  Anything to validate such a blasphemous statement? Probably not.  A LexusLS with 40-50k miles on the clock couldn't be as reliable as a 7, A8, or an S, no matter who's driving it. A twenty year old Porsche 911 can still beat the crap out of a Corolla in terms of performance, and yeah, a five year old lscan beat the crap out a new A8 in terms of reliabilty. An A8 will have more problems in the first year than the entire life of an LexusLS."
"The only hybrid that I know of that is in constant demand is the Prius all the others seem to range from ok to not selling wellmerc, here's how it is with the hybrids.  So far the Prius and the '06 Honda Civic Hybrid are in significant demand.  The upcoming Honda Fit Hybrid will with certainty be in significant demand as well.  What this shows is that, at least so far, the hybrid option can do very well at the economy tier.  The Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid and the Honda Accord Hybrid have not done well at all and there are a number of reasons.  The upcoming Camry Hybrid will prove the REAL hybrid potential in middle ground.  If it pulls it off, then the playing field is wide open.  If not, then it will show that the hybrids are polarized to the lower tier . . . and upper tier IF,IF,IF the LS600h is successful.  Personally, I believe that the lshybrid will do very well, and will establish a genuine upper tier market.  To be seen, of course.If all the hurdles are cleared and a 50 state diesel is possible MB, BMW and Audi will sell diesels in good numbers. I know Mercedes will, wanna place a gentleman's bet on it?The Mercedes BluTech diesel is very likely to be available in ALL 50 states.  This is what I was mentioning to ljflx earlier when I indicated that I don't want to commit to anything until I know more about diesel availability.  I have driven the current 320cdi and it is a fabulous powerplant.  The more significant question to this forum is whether or not it shows up in the S.  The next question is what progress has Mercedes made in the hybrid front?  After all, Toyota/Lexus has an enormous treasure of experience with hybrid technology.  And what car would Mercedes utilize it in anyway, and how many years down the pike, if they do something?  I think it is most likely Lexus will have the advantage in the hybrid arena, and Mercedes could kick some very serious butt in the diesel arena, if they move forward with it soon enough.TagMan"

"The problem with VW Phaeton is that it is overpriced. No way is the Phaeton overpriced! The Phaeton is cheaper than the SClass and 7Series.  It wasn't intended from the start to compete with cars like the LexusLS which isn't a ""benchmark"" in Europe.  Europe being where VW wanted to make an engineering statement in MB's face. Selling it here was debated, delayed and then half-done.  The car was intended to be a cheaper rival to the SClass and to a lesser degree the 7Series and it is cheaper than those cars. The problem with the Phaeton is the VW badge, dealer body and to a lesser degree VW's bad reliability reputation. You're right the first generation LexusLS was cheap. If I remember right it was about the price of a 190E, around 35K base and 41K or so with the few options it had back then. No one can build a car of the lsor Phaeton's specification for that type of money in today's market.  Not gonna happen.  The Phaeton is priced right compared to its other German rivals, but everything else is off as I mentioned above.  The biggest problem is that ""VW"" stands for inexpensive cars, not luxury cars.  Phaetons can be had for 10-15K off sticker according to some on these boards, now if that doesn't sell them it has to be the badge. That and the fact that most people don't even know the car exists. Now imo if VW wanted to ""save"" the car they should bring over the SWB Phaeton with the V8 and sell it for E500/550i/A6 4.2 money.  That might interest buyers in the same way some buyers look at an E500 or A6 4.2. and then find a much bigger LexusLS far more attractive because they see the similarly priced base LexusLS as a rung up from the mere mid-size/level luxury cars.  I seriously doubt they'll throw any more money at the Phaeton at this point, but I think it would work. M"
"The question is, in comparing the MB-S series, the BMW high end (whatever it's called, 700 series I think), and the LexusLS, what has been a better car the past several years, taking everything into consideration (luxury, build quality, dependability, etc., etc.)? I think that the unequivocal answer to this question is the LexusLS. You will notice that I did not even bring up the fact that the lscosts about $10-20 thousand less. That makes it even more of a winner. Now, what about the future? Is this going to change? I very much doubt it. With the gorgeous LS460 coming out and more importantly the LS600HL, I don't see how things are going to change much. The lswill still be the better vehicle, period. Isn't this the most important factor? Better when you stack the criteria in favor of the LexusLS. No where in there does performance, handling, styling or anything else that actually relates to it being a car as opposed to an appliance even come up.  Secondly this about the lsbeing more luxurious doesn't hold water.  The car is no more ""luxurious"" than a SClass or A8. Softer leather?  Big deal, it will look like crap when the 2nd onwer gets his hands on it.  Many buyers don't give a ""flying leap"" about all this dependability/reliablity superiority that Lexus defenders constantly harp about it, if they MB/BMW/Audi wouldn't be able to sell cars, and they all do it for more money on top of that.  On paper the lslooks to be the end-all vehicle to some, yet right here on Edmunds you'll find a few Lexus owners have left and some buyers that found it to be a totally insipid vehicle. A luxury car of this ilk has to do more than win in surveys and being Mr. Practical, that is something Lexus doesn't seem to grasp, at least not yet.  The new lsis anything but gorgeous, of course IMO. M"
"I fully agree with your previous post.Lexus' latest assault on BMW in regards to the IS is nothing short of amazing. Never in the company's history have they produced anything remotely close to tearing down the 3. The IS is the car that should've been here with the '00 3Series. I have absolute repect for the car as it embodies what it takes (to some degree) to be a successful sport sedan. Some tweaking of the chassis, better steering feel, higher grip tires, a more reclined rear seat and BMW may have something to worry about. This is something Lexus may correct with the second year of productionNow, if Lexus does green light the ISClass, then the M3/RS4/CTS-v/C55 AMG crowd will get some serious comp.But all is not peachy at Lexus. They still don't know what to do about the GS. First they were to give the V6 more oomph but where would that leave the V8(for now)? Then they were to kill off the V8 model completely for the GS450h? Just install the new 4.6 and call it a day to stay competitive. A complete overhaul(excluding the RX- kill the RX400h tho) of their SUV's is well overdue. The GX remains unimpressive, and the LX, altho very capable and comfortable, is dated in it's category. The HPX would serve Lexus proud.BMW on the other hand: This company knows what it's customer wants and it delivers. The i-Drive confusion(altho I don't see how it was so confusing) did little to sway it's loyalist away from the brand. With a new 3Series Coupe, the new X5, the newly introduced X7(a Escalade/RR rival), and a slew of M cars, the company has plenty to keep it's customer base happy. A refreshed 5Series in '08 should keep it inline with  EClass  and A6. And let's not forget the long-awaited 7Series for '08(on sale late fall '07). This is the car that is supposed to correct all shortcoming of the current model. With a projected first ever diesel-hybrid, a direct injected 420-hp V8, a first ever M model(finally), and a MB-beating 612hp V12 with a DCX-esque cylinder shutoff, the 7 may longer be the laughing stock in it's class....."
"The ls's *free fall* in sales is nothing to do with its competition but more to do with its pending model change over. You should know that, Merc1... Lexus has one of the highest owner retention in the industry... Many owners are simply waiting on their hands to buy the LS460 and its other variants... When you see the new LexusLS, why would you not wait another 5 months ??? Oac read the post I was replying to, specifically the Doc's rant about C-Class sales.  What you're telling me I already know and stated that in the same post Oac! I personally don't see how anyone could buy a LexusLS at this point with the 1000 times improved LS460 pending. The right adjective here would be IMO... A car as successful as the LexusES clearly has a lot of things going for it. It is the clear and undisputed leader in its sector... Its not even close... You don't have to like it, but to categorically diss it like you do smacks of hate and lack of objectivity. You simply have a one-track mentality of cars... they should drive like they are on a track otherwise condemn them to the scrap yard... Get real ! Ok, IMO its one of the ugliest cars on the road.  Is that better?  You're right the LexusES is the clear leader in its segment, problem is its the ONLY car in its segment.  There are no other fwd imports playing the same game anymore so you really aren't saying much to say its the leader in its segment.  If I have a one-track mentality about how a car should drive then you clearly have one about cars when it comes sales.  With you all that matters if the car sells or not, not how it looks, drives or anything else.  If the car doesn't sell or doesn't have the stamp of approval from CR or JDP then it isn't worthy. That is as one-tracked/sided as it gets.  For the record I don't think cars should all drive the same way. Again, if you had read my post to DrFill you would have seen why I pointed out the dynamic differences of the LexusES vs. the other cars in its price range.  As far as ""getting real"" I think you'd be wise to follow your own advice there especially when it comes to your hyping up and preaching about the Lexus brand so when called into question you won't have to go back on your  iffy claims about the competition. M"
"This was also nicely underscored by Lexus in their ad campaign for the RX a couple of years ago, showing ""engineers"" from what would be competitors testing, driving, and prodding every new feature on the RX. Yeah I saw those ads, but showing Italian engineers studying the RX didn't make much sense to me because nothing from Italy that I know of competes with the RX, or any Lexus really.  Especially in this country. I think there are two very distinct factions at GM.  The engineers who could do better and the bean counters that won't let them.   The problem is worse now because when GM was making the money the beaners wouldn't let the engineers spend any of it on better details so now since they aren't making any the choice is literally gone.  The guys in that article know GM is way behind and could likely engineer a better product, but now they'll never get the leeway to do it.  Then again a crisis does bring out the best in some companies and if these new full size SUVs are hits maybe they'll spend some of the profits on high-volume cars and not Corvette Z06s and STS/XLR-Vs. M"
"Those who love capitalism and its benefits should push for more profit increases. Lexus should gun more for capitalists who love ""commanding premium"" along with its current customer base.Let's not confuse unit profits with corporate profits.  If Lexus jacked up its lsprices by 50% it might raise per-unit profits, but unit volumes would fall enough that corporate profits would suffer.When the lswas introduced in 1989, Lexus had little to offset the established image and prestige of MB.  So of course it had to significantly underprice MB if it were to ever sell comparable numbers of units.  Something has to offset prestige in the buyer's mind, and presumed reliability isn't enough for some buyers.Over the years, Lexus has improved in prestige, and this has enabled them to narrow the price gap with MB.  But we all know that MB still enjoys a prestige advantage, so again there must be some offset if Lexus is to sell comparable or higher numbers of units.  As long as a prestige gap remains, so to will a price gap, imho.  But you will see Lexus continue to narrow that gap as its prestige improves."
"We are talkig percentages based on the Blue Book! Absolute dollars has no relevance whatsoever!!  Call it ESP but I sense a whole slew of future statistical-related posts! Dewey, if you are correct on this I for one would be surprised.  Len, I would say the true measure of residual value is not ""current resale/original MSRP"", but ""current resale/original purchase price (or cap cost)"".  Some cars typically sell at bigger discounts than others, so MSRP is not necessarily a comparable number between different brands for true original cost.On that score, if after 3 years you can sell a typical 7 for a higher percentage of  original purchase price than a typical LexusLS, I would be impressed.  To actually figure that out, I assume you could use the links to Edmunds' TMV pricing that Len gave us back in #10790 to determine what a car could be sold for now (I would suggest using the ""sale by a private party"" as the basis for current resale - that takes the dealer markup/markdown out of the equation).  Then you would somehow need to figure out what those cars actually sold for back in 2002.In my zipcode, Edmunds says the typical 3 yr old 745Li would sell for $42,029 and the typical lswould sell for $33,809.  To be conservative, let's assume the lsoriginally was bought for $55,000 (which is only about $1000 less than I paid for my '05 with Nav system, premium stereo, etc.).  So the lsretained over 61% of original cost.  For the 745 to match that, it would have had to have sold for less than $68,372.  But Edmunds says a ""typically equipped"" 2005 745Li would now actually sell for $75,978. 2005 745Li pricingLet's say that 3 years ago it would have sold for $2,000 less than in '05 (twice the amount I took off for the LexusLS, just to be conservative again).  That would mean that the 745 could have been bought for $73,978.  Therefore, the 745 has kept less than 57% of its value after 3 years.So which is the residual value leader - the lsthat retained over 61% or the 745Li that retained less than 57%?Oh yeah, I know, this was one of those ""statistical-related posts"" that you apparently think are irrelevant...."
"We'll people always bashed Lexus for not having any kind of styling ""direction"" and that each car just kind of did its own thing. Now they are starting to build some cars with a ""family"" resemblance, and you're bashing them for that. What should they do? No I'm not bashing them for having a family resemblance, I'm just wondering if all the MB/Audi detractors that bashed Audi and especially Mercedes for doing the same thing are going to say anything about Lexus doing it.  Of course they aren't because just like I said when people here were knocking the A4 and C-Class for looking like scaled down A8s andSClasses, when Lexus does this it will be seen as some great styling home run.   Fast foward, and that is what happened just as I and Lexus said it would do.  But just a few years ago right here in this very board the SClass was devauled because it had a C-Class clone running around, now since Lexus has done the same thing with the lsand IS, its a smart practice.  The A8 and A4 are no different from the IS and LexusLS, now.  Both sets of cars are nothing more than a scale up/down of the same theme for both brands. Of course since Lexus has managed to make a lsthat doesn't look like poor copy of a Benz the raves are pouring in on the other board with the S being dated and what not.  Benz had better knock off 20K from the price or tweak the S before it goes on sale here, nevermind the fact that it is already on sale in Europe so it would be impossible to ""tweak"" it for the U.S. market as far as styling goes.  Such hype I haven't read a quite a while.  It's 1989 all over again and yet even in 1989 Benz and everyone else went on doing what they're going to do in 2006, sell cars.  This end of the world talk is really beyond silly at this point, imo. M"
"There's nothing wrong with comparing the production curve of any two car models. Just don't compare the first model year of one car with the winding down year of another, like what you were trying to do . . . that would be intellectually dishonest because we both know that cars sell much better in the early parts of its procution cycle. Again, you brought up the comparo between the CLS and IS/GS.  However there is something wrong with this comparo because you said that the IS and GS were successful if we're going by the 14K units the CLS sold.  This is just that, dishonest because the CLS costs way more than a GS and nearly double the first generation IS.  Secondly IN THEIR SEGMENTS the IS and GS didn't do squat in sales compared to their main competitors, BMW and Mercedes.  The CLS doesn't really have an direct competitors. It is just that, dishonest for you to leave out the other factors in the sales of these three totally different vehicles. When was the last time MB newly conqured any market segment? 1970/80's displacing Cadillac? Well considering Mercedes the oldest carmaker around and new segments don't come along that often I'd say they've done pretty well to inpsire the creation of whole brands of synthetic cars with a copycat flagship to go along with it.  Mercedes has proven itself time and time again over the years.  Question is what segment has Lexus conqured?  Lexus is the biggest wannabe in the automotive world, now switching their envy from Mercedes to BMW.  I don't see anyone lining up to build a GS,LS,IS or LexusES.  I do see Lexus trying to build a 3Series, 5Series, SClass (in the past come 2007).  I do see Jaguar, Porsche, and VW linig up to build a CLS competitor, not a GS competitor or a lscompetitor.  All Lexus has conqured is quality and reliability surveys (important enough) and the SUV/high-end-sedan segment IF you want simply look at sales.  Other than that they are are the ultimate following machine because the IS,GS,ES haven't conqured squat.  Like it or not Mercedes-Benz is still the trailblazer here.  The CLS and R-Class success or not are new segments, one of which has a bunch of the competitors lining up to produce their version (CLS) and the other the jury is still out on.  M"

So much venom against Lexus..... Obviously, you habor a deep resentment towards Lexus' success over your vaunted German brand. That's OK... All the put-downs about Lexus isn't stopping its match towards increased market share, be it against MB or BMW. Talking of copying, I wonder how many German auto companies would love to have the TPS in their factories, eh ???? Maybe no one thinks the TPS is such a great system, eh ??? Who would have thunk it that Lexus could make such quality cars ? No one is copying Lexus' customer service, build quality, reliable automobiles, seamless integration of electronics, 8-speed tranny, hybrid synergy system, TPS, etc. Totally unimportant in the car business, eh ? Alrighty.... let's move on...Lexus having proven itself a worthy and dangerous competitor to MB, now turns its sight on BMW. Let's see how well Lexus does against BMW. Infiniti already puts a chink in the Bimmer's armor, and a combined Japanese assault on BMW may do more damage over time. I guess time will tell...Enjoy your trip to Detroit. Go well. Let's hear from you at your earliest convenience. We will surely have lots to talk about in days, weeks, months to come."
"Well you'll have to excuse me if I don't understand how theSClass' looks could be a problem and the ls's aren't. I guess you'll have to excuse me for not understanding why you don't see the difference between the current LexusLS, which I agree is derivative of the W140 SClass that I said in my post that I liked, and the new S which I said I don't like (particularly for the exact same reasons that I think you have expressed concerns about in a number of your posts-- i.e., the rear and the wheel flares).I don't know how I could be more clear on this, or what you are missing.  I love the W220, like the W140, and therefore like (not love) the lsthat looks much like the W140.  I dislike the new W221, which looks nothing like the current LexusLS.  To me, there is no inconsistency in liking the current lsmore than the upcoming S.  But my personal value system puts more emphasis on reliability and long term ownership experience than on styling-- so I chose the lsover the current S when it came to spending my own money, not just looking at pictures.So what are we disagreeing about with regard to the W140, the W220 and the W221?I also agree that the '07 lsdesign is likely pretty locked down at this point.  But that doesn't mean that over the last year or two the Lexus folks weren't following MB's design prototypes even more closely than the typical Edmunds forum poster did (I may be jaundiced, but I don't think corporate espionage ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall), and my comment was only meant to emphasize my expectation that Lexus will continue in its own direction rather than try to emulate the direction MB has taken the S."
"Um, LG? What platforms does Audi share with VW?A8- unique to Audi(the Phaeton is all steel, with Audi's chassis)A6- unique to AudiA4- unique to AudiNow, I'll suffice it to say and give you credit on the A3. It is a Golf(Rabbit) derivative. But it too has been Audi fortified with quattro and 3.2L V6/DSG, none available on the Golf.And the Q7: Audi designed this platform in '01 for Porsche, Audi, and VW collab. Audi designed the powertrains(except Porsche's 4.5L V8's), 4WD systems, systems, interior layouts, and suspensions.I'm confused? What platforms again?"
"Well, as you mentioned, the overall market has grown since 1989 and everyone has benefited. We went from one to two to three car families. Can someone analyze who has taken the biggest pieces of the pie since then? I&#146;m sure they can and would like to hear about it.I would love to see the analysis too. My neighbor has 5 cars, for a 2-person family. We sure live in excess of our needs sometimes. The new LS460/460L/600h would peel off even more S and 7Series buyers, and expand the market and sales growth even more.But the simple fact remains that Lexus ain&#146;t conquering the world like Alexander the Great, Hannibal and the Roman Empire. I have to disagree somewhat. Where did all 300K sales come from ? Cadillac, Lincoln, MB, mostly. The new car-based SUV market for the RX, and the obliteration of the mid-size lux market by the LexusES. Of course, the lsdid its share peeling off a large chunk of would-be and ex MB owners."

Send an email to me via Pat (host) if you are interested (just request that it be forwarded to me).I only make bets on securities that have a margin of safety. Your bet offers no margin of safety.

"A8- unique to Audi(the Phaeton is all steel, with Audi's chassis)  A6- unique to Audi  A4- unique to Audi """"""Actually get a reality check, the A4 is not a unique Audi platform.  It's been a Passat platform underneath for years.  You can bet platform sharing is growing too.  You can eventually bet on a Audi A6 being spun out of a stretched Passat platform also.  Not to mention you can bet on Benz's and Chrysler products sharing platforms.  it's already started with products like the Crossfire and SLk, and it's moving onto to parts sharing like transmissions from Benz's being in Chrysler's now as well as suspension component's. it's not far before a 300 and aEClass could end up using the same platform.  They will have to do it to be more competitive and to produce cars more efficiently. You can thank Toyota for that!"
"What about the fact that buyers TODAY have more choices of high-end lux cars than in the past, say a decade ago, that you don't understand ? Lexus and Infiniti are new entrants within the past 15 years, right ? Prior to 1990, its either MB or BMW... Now Lexus via its LexusLS, and Infiniti via its G cars have provided much better competition to the dominance of the traditional leaders (MB and BMW). I got that part long ago, its the relevence I'm trying to figure out.  First it was MB isn't the choice for the high-end buyer, now it has shifted to there are more choices.  We all know that. Anyone can see this.  Sure the market has expanded and MB and BMW have expanded their sales with it.    Back before Lexus and all the newcomers MB/BMW never broke 100K sales a year, now they're both over 200K a year.  Prior to 1990, there was Jaguar, Audi, and Cadillac also, not just BMW and Mercedes.  Were those others good choices?  Thats open for debate for sure, but they were there sure enough. I never argued that buyers don't have more choices today, only that MB is still the main choice for the high-end buyer, which is what you started out with a few posts back.  Infiniti's G35 has nothing to do with your original point about MB and the high-end buyer or the high-end luxury buyer period. The Q45 does however and its a dud of the highest order.  Infiniti isn't even a player at the high-end of the market.  Audi sells more A8s than Infiniti does Q45s. Of course there is more competition all around, I didn't debate that.  I couldn't debate that with a 1/2 dozen newer and/or revised cars in the E's segment alone this year,  for example.  Yes, 7Series may be selling well for a 7Series, but it remains a distant third to the LexusLS. So I am looking at the bigger picture of the entire class, not the narrow picture of solely the 7Series sales record...So what, the 7Series costs more than the LexusLS to begin with.  Secondly how are you looking at the whole picture when the gist of your post is again about sales compared to the lsand not BMW's bottom line?  You're only looking at sales relative to a much cheaper car and ignoring the fact that the current 7Series has surpassed the record for any 7Series before it. Why is it that the 7Series has to outsell the lsfor it to be a success in your eyes, but the GS doesn't have to outsell the 5Series to be a hit?  Major contradiction there.  Sales, again aren't the sole indicator of whether or not a car is a success or not. I see you withdrew your post with that claim about who sells more cars between 50-80K so I'll delete mine that disproved it. M"
"Even though Toyota has forgotten about the sports car market, they still make Best-selling Tacoma, have legendary truck heritage with Land Cruiser/FJ Cruiser, INNOVATIVE (Yes, I said INNOVATIVE) SUVs like the RX, they make great cars, great hybrids, and they've sold a luxury car or two through some scrub off-shoot......I forget the name of it right now. But it's doing ok. Certainly nothing to shout about.  There is no variation there, its either trucks, suvs or sedans.  Yawn!  Toyota is the most uptight of the Japanese brands by far and no amount of warming over the same chassis to create sedans/suvs/trucks is going to count as any type of ""variation"".  Toyota is about quality, reliable, transportation devices, period.  One sports car since 1993 is pitiful especially since according to all the Toyota worshipers here Toyota can do anything it wants.  Apparently they can't make one truly exciting car. Toyota and Lexus = Quality, Dullard, Consumer Goods. M"
"What car do they consider the ""one"" to have then? Is it a singular brand or is spread out between Lexus/BMW/Infiniti? I ask because I don't know anyone my age that aspires to own a Lexus, even though one of my best friends has one...[Sigh]For us the MB mystique is just not there. We prefer Lexus, BMW and Infiniti - 330/528/530/745, G35/Q45, ES/LS/RX/LX/GX... and a couple of MBs (320/500). As for me, I have 3 cars at home, with the lsas the family sedan - luxurious, reliable, quality, dependable and solid. Maybe my fav car to drive is the Toyota Matrix. I have written about it quite a few times. For those times when family and friends come visiting, or transporting my daughter's girl scout troop to camp, boating trips, kayaking trips, family soft ball games, etc... the Sequoia comes in handy.

"Where exactly did anyone say that? The silly comments about Lexus being an upscale Buick make you look bad. if it was that easy GM would have upgraded Buick or Cadillac a long time ago. The moment I see a comment like that is the moment I know I'm dealing with a a person who can't handle Lexus' success. As for the IS - they are buying the success of the brand's quality and reliability and assuming it's in the IS. It is said here all the time by the Lexuscamp.  Lexus is just ""better"" with no reason as to why.  What do the founding Lexi like the LexusES and lsreally have over a Buick other than rwd and and of course a better quality of build?  Seriously whether or not the question makes me ""look bad"" a real answer would be nice.  No, I'm not saying that a Lexus isn't superior to those GM cars, but I'd like to hear why you think they (the car not the dealer and what not) are. A ES350 is a much of a Lexus as the LexusLS is and it certainly is as good as the GS for what Lexus buyers buy them for.  Seriously why would anyone shopping for a Lexus buy a GS over a LexusES or even LexusLS unless they need more room as in the case of the LS? I really would like to know this from you because you've spoken so highly of the lsand besides the room what does it really give you over an ES?  The concept (reliablity, lots of beige leather and isolation) is the same. For eons MB's story was bullet proof reliability, rarely was performance and MB ever mentioned together until the last 10 years when MB moved more in that direction. True, but this is where the heritage part comes in becuse Mercedes was know more for innovations than reliablity as Toyota/Lexus fans know it today.  Unlike Lexus, Mercedes' story included that about their reliablity, but it also included innovations. I mean look at the things they've introduced to the market that EVERY car in production uses now.  That alone was worth its weight in gold.  Mercedes was also known for their racing victories too along with performance LJ.  That about performance having only come up in the last 10 years simply isn't true and is sure sign of someone not really familiar with the brand.  Mercedes bigger cars back in day are what created all that autobahn high-speed talk. A 1986 560SEL would do 140mph and could get 60 mph in 7.0 second flat, which was fast for that time. The only part of Mercedes performance resume that has been improved in the last 10 years is how they handle, not much else because a lot of their cars were always powerful and fast.  Just because you've only heard performance and Mercedes mentioned together only recently doesn't mean it hasn't always been there. Mercedes' reliability was so stellar because of all the other European cars of the day were much worse and anything American was just junk.   When people say this I find it funny  because MB's peers of the day were BMW/Audi/Jaguar, not a reliable one in that bunch back then so of course Mercedes looked as though it was not of this earth.  Of course when the Japanese moved the bar beyond Mercedes and Mercedes made some mistakes in the 90's this problem got worse, but I seriously doubt a Mercedes-Benz was ever like a modern day Toyota in reliablity.

"Who here said that price was the only reason and that if priced equally the MB and BMW models would sell at the same rate as the Lexus? Talk about reaching! Well, Merc1, I haven't ever heard you give any other reason expect PRICE for why the lssells more than the S + BMW combined. If you have seen the error in your previous position and swung to embrace the common thread on this topic, so be it. But we all can read and there is a track record here....What you simply can't admit or see is that price does make a difference to some if not all the buyers in this segment.As pointed out here, the lease difference b/w a $75K SClass is only about a couple hundred $ higher than a $63K LexusLS. Are you implying that a greater proportion of those who lease the LexusLS cannot afford to lease an SClass ? Yet the SClass sells so pitifully against the LexusLS. I submit that price is the least of the factor, especially consdiering the higher prestige of the MB over the Lexus. But of course, you have your position which is unshakeable, so let us move on....."
"Why does one want to buy all their cars from the same company thoughout one's lifetime? Same reason why one keeps buying Lexuses over and over, because they like what the brand offers.  My point was the MB/BMW has more choice.  Didn't say that someome should do this, I said that they could if they wanted too and they wouldn't have to buy the same boring sedan over and over. There it goes again, among the cars that Lexus offer, they beat MB class for class. So don't compare cars Lexus does not make i.e. AMG car lines. I even bet you: if Lexus makes cars costing $100K or more in the future, they will still beat MB class for class. Lexus isn't even close to beating MB class for class.  The SC430 got beat by the previous generation CLK430 and the current SL500, the GS may be scoring a point victory in the mags over  EClass  now, but the E crushes the GS in the every important (at least here it is)  sales race.  The lsmanages to beat theSClass, and has never beat the  SClass in any comparo I've seen.   Lexus doesn't beat MB class for class in sales either when you look at the numbers, only the lsbeats the SClass when you match sedans to sedans.  MB kill Lexus in the 2-door coupe/roadster classes about as much as Lexus does the same to MB in the SUV class when it comes to sales. So I'm not sure where you got this from about Lexus beating MB class for class.  No other import maker sells a fwd luxury car like the LexusES.  M"
"Wow! You really think that the typical Lexus HELM buyer is no more sophisiticated than the typical Buick buyer? Because that's largely what you have described. That is pretty much it. Really. You never hear anything about how the car drives,looks or anything ""car-like"".   It is always surveys, price and this talk of luxury, which means not feeling anything and in the case of the LexusLS the flattest seats possible.  The LexusES and SCfollow the same isolationist formula.  They've been called ""Buick-like"" by more than one tester over the years. M"
"Yes, at projected 25MPG, that's less than 30% better fuel efficiency than an LS460. So come again with the ""conserve fuel"" thingy !!! And why do you tell me I don't know what Lexus brand mission is ? Care to educate me since you know it so well... SheeshWell you don't seem to have a clue as to what it is yourself. Now you're wording that ""30 percent"" as though it is no big deal yet when this car hits the market you'll be doing all the cheering about how good its MPG numbers are and how it duplicated some German's V12s in performance. What is the point of spending so much money on a hybrid if not to at least to get better MPG while in Lexus' case to also get better performance?  If the aim was just to duplicate BMW/Audi (not a prayer of duplicating MB V12 performance) then why not just build a V12 like everyone else?  Explain to me why the LS600h L is a hybrid not just another big-engined top of the line sedan like the 760Li or a8 W12? So in your world, only hybrids tout their MPG ratings ? Haven't seen many car ads lately ??? See again, another example of a twist.  Of course hybrids are about their MPG numbers, that is their main function in most cases.  Those ads you're talking about are for regular cars, not high-end cars so that leave Lexus out of the MPG hard-sell ads you see on TV right now.  and you do know what every Prius owner/greenie thinks as well, and how this will impact LS600hL perception by these greenies, eh ??? Nope, of course not just like you don't know if the opposite will happen.  I made that point about 2 pages ago. M"
"You are quick to rag on the GS, but the last gen did VERY WELL in direct comparisons to the 540 and E420 in competitive comparisons, just not in sales.I dont really remember that. The GS picked up an Import of the year in MT for '98 (which doesnt mean all that much, MT has given plenty of ""of the year's"" to some terrible cars), and it was a 10-best winner once, maybe twice. Once the A6 actually got more than 200hp though, the GS would always lose to it and the 5. The 540i was a beloved car that dominated comparison tests like the 3Series still does. I don't recall the 98-05 GS ever getting an outright 1st place in any comparo vs the Germans. It really wasn't that great of a car. The V8 was very fast in a straight line, but handling was just average, and it had the all-time worst Lexus interior.I wouldnt expect anything for the GS any time soon other than an engine swap, and possibly a VDIM off button. If sales were like the RL's it would be getting emergency treatment, but I think as long as it maintains 2K+ a month, they will stay the course.I dont think the new LexusES looks bad. It certainly is better looking than the ES330. The one thing I think they messed up is that in order to fit with the ""L-finesse"" interior design theme of the other new sedans, they took out almost all of the wood from the last car. The interior is a lot more modern, but it also seems somewhat less luxurious."
"You say that the Q7 has a boring ad. Well picture this, an RX350 ad that shows the car driving at night then all of a sudden it crosses paths with a deer. The ad was to highlight the swivel headlights of the RX. Nothing special as every carmaker has them now. No word on the mechanicals of the RX. Not utility. Not seating configurations. Nothing. Haven't even seen ads for the LexusES and IS yet. But they're still running the 1 year old ads on the LS', maybe in an attempt to sell the leftovers, which is brilliant.That RX ad is not my favorite, but it still works very well. Most people probably aren't aware that most luxury cars have swiveling headlights now (anyway, Tucker and Citroen did the swiveling headlight thing LONG before Lexus, Mercedes, or Audi). The RX ad points out a fancy feature on the Lexus people may not be aware of, using a memorable situation. The ""dimpled panels"" ad for the lsis very similar. They don't have to get into something as boring as mechanicals or seating configurations. Mechanicals are for sports cars, and seating configurations are for minivans. The RX is neither. The point of a TV ad should be to get you to remember the car. The RX ad does that. The Q7 ad does not. The IS350 ads aim squarely at 3Series buyers, so pretty much all the talk is about its 306 hp and how fast it is. The LexusES ""Is it possible to engineer desire?"" ad uses robotic ""fingers"" to slam home the message of interior luxury. Why cant Audi come up with something clever and memorable like that? Pretty much all of the mags agree that their interiors are magnificent, but I can't remember a single Audi commercial that even mentioned their interiors at all.The Q7 commercial reminded me of something Mercury or some other brand that has no idea of its mission or what its products are about would do. Play song, show car, wrap it up with ""Q7, from the makers of Quattro"". I'm already in a coma. Audi isn't like that, they do have great products, you just wouldn't know it by seeing the ad."
"You seem to say best value doesn't mean ""best"" overall..According to the recent Road and Track, Car and Driver, JDP, CR, and Resale Values, High price doesn't mean BEST either....You still don't explain why Lexus makes more Profit off the LexusLS than MB makes off a SClass DESPITE being 15K less!!! You subscribe to the foolish notion that Pricier means better...Did you know a $15 Timex is more reliable and accurate than a 15K Rolex??? I never said that high price always meant &#147;best&#148;, but in this particular instance it does. The LexusLS is a good value, but that doesn&#146;t mean that it&#146;s the best. You can spend more on an SClass and get the best or you can spend 70% of that on the lsand get 70% of the car. As far as your watch analogy is concerned: Apples and Oranges. The differences between highly complex, multi-faceted products such as luxury cars can&#146;t be boiled down to the simple difference between a Rolex and a Timex. If anything Lexus is a battery powered knock-off Rolex made of yellow plastic with a quartz movement. Sounds like the high price of the S is due to inefficiency more than price premium..Here's where profits are important: Less profit, less R&D..As far as I've seen it, Toyota has taken on R&D projects where it can profit immensely from. You're completely ignoring the whole business side to this. Yes I am ignoring the business side to this. I&#146;m not comparing the fiscal policies of MB and Lexus, I am comparing their products. Just because Lexus is more profitable (which you haven&#146;t proven) than MB doesn&#146;t mean that Lexus makes better cars. Less R&D? Is that why most of the features on your lscame from the MB or BMW R&D department? Is less R&D why Lexus is still riding on the coattails of MB for innovation? Interesting.  Actually Boeing and Airbus differ big time on design. Fly by Wire vs Mechanical Controls is a HUGE issue in the aviation world. (Air Force 1 does not have Fly by Wire, despite it being available at the time) British Airways has insisted the 747 Advanced NOT have Fly by wire. The 747 has triple redunancy on all critical systems whereas the A340 has two. The 747 does have more innovative safety features than the A340, yet this has not stopped airlines from buying the Airbus..You should stop and think whether any corporation is going to open themselves up to lawsuits from a product that is ""unsafe"" or ""poorly engineered"" That&#146;s probably because no body knows these details. If the public knew that Boeing made a safer jet than Airbus, you can be sure that airlines that fly Boeing would get more business. Much is the same with Lexus and Mercedes. Most people are sheep who follow the Lexus cult ignorant of the fact that Lexus lags behind the market for safety, doesn&#146;t even offer rear side airbags or that the SC430 doesn&#146;t have rollover protection. And if you think corporations don&#146;t take chances with products that are &#147;unsafe&#148; I submit to you Hyundai, possibly the most unsafe vehicles as per IIHS crash tests. Also, GM and Ford are currently involved in a number of class action lawsuits regarding their poorly engineered SUV/Truck roofs that collapse in rollovers because they are still designed to 1970s strength specifications, while Volvo/MB/BMW have exceeded those specifications five times over for decades.  Given that Lexus commands a high customer loyalty I doubt they'd risk their business by building cars that are unsafe. If they can spend $4 Billion on the original LexusLS do you think they'd skimp on $500 electronics?? They've chose to spend their R&D on Award Winning Customer Service, NAV's, Hybrids, superior reliability, and cutting edge electronics whilst building a car that is STILL recommended by the NHTSA and various other agencies for safety.. Well obviously they decided to skimp in $500 rear airbags, $500 roll protection bars (SC), and $500 rear load limiters on most models. They skimped on the passenger airbags for 4 years. They skimped on head protection airbags for 2 years. They also decided to wait 4 years after MB and BMW to adopt the most significant safety feature since the seatbelt, ESC. IIHS and NHTSA crash tests do not account for safety features such as these and only provide us with a limited view of a cars comprehensive safety in two designer tests.  When you add up all the skimping, waiting and corner cutting that Lexus has done over the years, it&#146;s obvious that they aren&#146;t exactly the most safety conscious brand.  It only makes sense to assume that a company like Mercedes would offer more comprehensive protection in all types of crashes because safety is a hallmark of their brand. Who would you expect to build a better race car? Someone with years of innovation, experience and leadership in the segment or a newcomer with a questionable record? Much the same can be said for safety. It&#146;s a hard thing to accept as long as you are blinded by brand loyalty and bias, so think of it this way, with two companies; company A and company B:Company A has been in the business of making safe cars for over 100 years. Company A offers the most standard and optional safety features than any other brand. Company A has introduced many important safety advances such as crumple zones, ABS, stability control, and seat belt pre-tensioners, just to name a FEW things. Company A is one of only two companies with active accident investigation teams to assess real world collisions in order to modify their designs. Company A offers the latest and greatest safety features and structural designs before most other brands. Company B has been in the business of making affordable cars for 15 years. Company B hasn&#146;t introduced any of its own pioneering safety features nor has it shown any particular interest in safety innovation. Company B often waits several years before it adopts the safety features pioneered by company A and others. Company B still doesn&#146;t offer many of the basic safety features that have been found in company A&#146;s cars for years. Assuming you have no bias, which of these two brands has an obvious advantage in the area of safety? Which would you expect to perform better in an accident? It seems pretty clear to me. Most people would pick company A, but if you&#146;re a Lexus fan you might pick company B."
"You seemed to pick on the Lexus interior, and mentioned it is ""Good in a straight line"". Actually, that was me. Quoting myself: The V8 was very fast in a straight line, but handling was just average, and it had the all-time worst Lexus interior.There's a big difference between objective and subjective results on a car. The GS might be able to match the numbers, but it ""felt"" sloppy compared to the 540, espeically w/ sport package. I think you'll find that most journalists would agree with that. I didnt have any problems with the audio and HVAC controls, Lexus always has done those in a very simple and straightfoward manner, and the GS was no exception. The problem was the rest of the interior. The design was incredibly dull, and it did not befit a $50K luxury car. Nearly all of it was either plastic or vinyl. It is definitely the hands down winner for worst Lexus interior. The 5Series and especially the A6 were vastly superior on the inside, in both design and materials. I feel rather strange defending the Germans, but despite the GS's reliability and its 0-60 prowess, the 5 and A6 were just better cars than the last gen GS. Looking at the three of them, its amazing just how brilliant that A6 interior was. The E430, GS400, and 540i interiors all look quite dated now, but the A6 looks just as sleek and modern now as it did then."
"You stated that the A8 was less ""safe"" than the LexusLS Where did I say that?  I implied that using aluminum only served to make the vehicle less safe than it otherwise would have been (ie. using steel in the same place as aluminum).  Aluminum being a much more brittle metal with much lower melting and flaming temperature, is certainly less safe than steel sheet metal.  The bending of sheet metal is a large part of the crumple zone's safety feature. the Germans were about safety long before the Japanese or Americans, only the Swedish understood the concept. (1) Even if your statement were true, then it's truely sad Germans no longer seems to hold that advantage; well, perhaps not.(2) In reality, MB and BMW historically had crash results, whereas Audis were historically poor.  Look at the A6 on IIHS for yourself."
"Your Logic would make Chrysler and Mercedes the same company...Heck Chrysler is carrying Mercedes. There is a HUGE difference between the Toyota/Lexus connection and the Mercedes/Chrysler connection. Mercedes and Chrysler were independent companies long before 1998 when Daimler-Benz purchased Chrysler group. Despite financial links, Mercedes maintains its independence as a separate entity from its corporate siblings. On the other-hand we have Toyota/Lexus. This isn&#146;t a matter of one company owning another company or one company merging with another company? Lexus quite literally IS Toyota in every sense. In Japan you won&#146;t find a domestic Lexus LexusLS on the road but you will see plenty of Toyota Celisors. &#147;Lexus&#148; was just re-badge stunt pulled here in the U.S. to lure unwitting American&#146;s into paying $60k for a Toyota. So yes, Lexus and Toyota are the same company? its been that way from the beginning.  All the Technology in the World is valueless if it doesn't work properly ..As I recall someone has already posted a list of often purchased parts that could effect the safety of the car.There was so much wrong with that link I&#146;m not sure where to begin. He tried to pull a fast one on all of us by posting some sort of amateur &#147;e-bay seller site&#148; and then telling us that it was definitive proof of Mercedes reliability issues. Furthermore, he claimed that he &#147;didn&#146;t see Lexus&#148; on this oh-so-professional and accurate website? which would make sense considering it was a European site and Lexus doesn&#146;t even appear on the radar in Europe.  I countered by listing a news release that told of a recent recall of 150k Camry&#146;s due to defective side airbags. Furthermore, I linked to an insurance page that listed several &#147;safety problems&#148; with Lexus vehicles. The point is, if you&#146;re going to provide &#147;proof&#148; of Mercedes reliability issues, at least provide some credible proof. Also, if you&#146;re going to preach about the reliability, don&#146;t pretend that Lexus is invincible. Rear seat airbags are of little value the Curtins that protect your head and the seatbelts are the essentual safety features...So Called safety features with little more value then bragging effect is worth how much?Wrong. I am simply floored by this comment. I understand that you may want to mitigate Lexus&#146; disregard for safety by belittling the importance of side airbags, but you simply cannot. Side airbags are vital in any type of side impact. Side head airbags (pioneered by BMW) ONLY protect the head. Side airbags provide protection for the torso and pelvis that a seatbelt alone cannot. The presence of a side airbag can mean the difference between life and death. Just look at some of the side impact tests on the IIHS website and notice how cars without side airbags score extremely poorly and those same cars with side airbags score markedly better. Saying that side airbags are unimportant is just as ridiculous as saying front airbags and seatbelts are frivolous features. They once did have a great reputation for safety and innovation...If I were buying a 60s or 70s or even 80s car it would be a Mercedes..Times change many cars now have learned from Mercedes and even helped move many of Mercedes safety innovations into the 21st. Century, The result is many cars now rival Mercedes in the area of safety. The problem with this statement is that Mercedes STILL DOES have a great reputation for safety and innovation. You speak in the past tense, that they &#147;did&#148; have a great reputation, even though Mercedes has been churning out safety innovations throughout the 90s and into the present. Please, explain to me how others have &#147;helped move many innovations into the 21st century.&#148; Last I checked, Mercedes was the one of the only ones pioneering these advances and furthermore had all the latest and greatest features years before Lexus. Only Volvo and BMW come close to matching the sheer number of Mercedes safety innovations. Lexus has contributed absolutely nothing and continues to leach off the R&D of others to this day.You constantly talk about cost cutting in the Lexus...That is true but far from the Negative you seem to want to project it to be.It seems pretty negative to me that Lexus decided to skimp and save $100 on their flagship sedan by not including rear side airbags. It seems pretty negative to me that Lexus decides to nickel and dime its customers for optional safety features like pre-safe.  It seems pretty negative that Lexus waits upwards of 4 years before adopting critical safety features on its models like ESC and head airbags, and even then makes some of these features optional / half-assed on lower priced models.  Correct me if I&#146;m wrong, but these are just a few of the many instances of Lexus cost cutting that seem pretty negative?The cost saving results partially from Lexus perfected heavy use of robots to build cars...the resulting percision is one of the primary reasons for the Lexus Reliability EDGE....Again, I already acknowledge that Lexus is more reliable. In fact, reliability is the only redeeming value of Toyota. Hopefully Toyota will force MB to make its cars more reliable, and then people won't have any reason to preach about the virtues of Lexus. However, for me reliability takes a back seat on my priority list when I shop for a car."
